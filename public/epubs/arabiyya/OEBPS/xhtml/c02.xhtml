			<p class="rt">Arab-Style Chicken Stock</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 8 cups of stock and 1 pound of shredded chicken</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IS THERE ANYTHING</span> more comforting than chicken stock, the soul-nourishing rich base for soups and stews—and the secret weapon of moms?</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mother always kept some on hand to make us chicken noodle soup, Arab-style. My recipe builds on the warmth of seven-spice mix with the addition of sweet fennel, herby cardamom pods, and a gentle peppercorn kick. I always make more than I need and keep the remainder in the freezer; it takes up less space when stored in a resealable bag, laid flat.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</p>
			<p class="ril">1 onion, quartered</p>
			<p class="ril">4 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon black peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ril">5 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">2 bay leaves</p>
			<p class="rpf">Warm the oil in a stockpot over medium heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Working in batches, sear the thighs for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the skin crisps and turns dark golden brown and the fat from the chicken releases into the cooking oil.</p>
			<p class="rp">When all the chicken is seared, wedge the onion and garlic onto the bottom of the pan among the chicken thighs. Sprinkle the salt, spice mix, fennel seeds, peppercorns, cardamom, and bay leaves over the chicken. Add enough water to cover the chicken (about 8 cups). Stir to mix in the spices, bring to a boil, and skim any foam from the surface. Turn down the heat to a low simmer, cover, and cook for 40 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through but not falling apart. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Strain the broth, reserving the stock and discarding the vegetable bits and any spice residue that’s collected in the bottom of the pot.</p>
			<p class="rp">The chicken can be shredded and added back into the stock along with some vegetables and noodles to make a flavorful light soup or repurposed into another meal such as the Shorbat Freekeh (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_168">this page</a>). You can store it in the fridge for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

			<p class="rt">Classic Fish Stock</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 12 cups (enough for all the recipes in this book that call for fish stock)</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">GROWING UP, WE</span> rarely ate fish at home, except when my mom fried frozen fillets to eat with rice. Whenever my father got a craving for seafood, he would pile us into the car for a visit to his favorite fish joint, the “No Name” restaurant on the Boston Harbor. He loved fish and ordered it anytime we went out, which, on our spare budget, was fairly infrequently.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Fish stocks are central to Arab cooking. You can ask your local market to save you leftover fish bones or reserve the bones and the head of fish you fillet at home.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This stock adds special depth to seafood dishes, including the stuffed squid Hibaar Mahshi (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_191">this page</a>), the shrimp clay pot remix Zidbiyat Gambari (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_193">this page</a>), and the rice and fish combo Sayadiyah (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_195">this page</a>). If you are cooking halal, you can skip the white wine.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Twenty minutes of simmering brings out the full flavor and luscious gelatinous base. Less oily fish such as halibut, snapper, and sole work best for broth. If you’re using an oilier fish such as salmon or cod, reduce the simmer time to 10 minutes to preserve the delicate flavor.</p>
			<p class="rilf">3 to 4 pounds fish bones and head</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup neutral oil, such as sunflower</p>
			<p class="ril">2 onions, cut into large chunks</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic heads, sliced midway root to stem</p>
			<p class="ril">1 fennel bulb, coarsely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">2 large celery ribs, cut into large chunks</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup white wine</p>
			<p class="ril">12 cups water, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">3 bay leaves</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon black peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rpf">If you are butchering your own fish and have bones, it’s a good idea to let them soak in cold water in the fridge for 1 to 4 hours to remove any residual blood. Drain and pat dry before using.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a stockpot, heat the oil on medium-high heat. Add the fish bones and head, rotating them to get color. Once the fish has begun to brown, about 10 minutes, remove the bones and head and reserve.</p>
			<p class="rp">Into the pot, add the onions, garlic, fennel, and celery and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Allow the wine to evaporate almost completely.</p>
			<p class="rp">Return the bones and head to the pot and add the water. Add additional water if needed to just cover the fish. Bring to a boil, scooping away and discarding any scum from the surface. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns, coriander, and salt and lower to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Strain the stock into a cooking pot if you’re using right away or into three 1-quart widemouthed jars or deli containers to refrigerate or freeze for later use. (If freezing, remember to cool in the fridge first, leaving a couple inches of space in the jars so that it doesn’t crack the jars or containers once frozen.) Discard the solids.</p>
			<p class="rp">The stock can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

			<p class="rt">Spicy Red Pepper Paste</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 1½ cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">AT REEM’S, WE</span> love making base condiments to incorporate into multiple dishes. This mildly spicy spread is delicious as a base for flatbreads and sandwiches and transforms into a great aioli when blended with egg yolk for fries (see <a href="c05.xhtml#page_157">this page</a> for Batata Harra). Add a touch of honey or brown sugar, and you have a delicious barbecue sauce marinade.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Dibs Al Fleifleh is a milder version of harissa paste; bell peppers balance the chile with sweetness, and the lemon, in turn, dials down the sweetness with its acidity. The vegetables’ liquids evaporate through slow cooking, intensifying the flavor.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This is a versatile condiment to have on hand. It can keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. If you will not be using it as frequently, you can freeze half and thaw when needed.</p>
			<p class="rilf">12 red Fresno chiles (about 12 ounces), stems, seeds, and veins removed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">4 or 5 large bell peppers (about 1½ pounds)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to cover</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons ground coriander</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon smoked paprika</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Finely chop the chiles and toss with the salt. Let sit for 30 minutes in a colander, until the chiles release their liquid.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the chiles are draining, coat the peppers in 1 tablespoon of the oil and roast in the oven, until they are collapsed and blistered, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the peppers from the oven, place in a bowl, and seal in plastic wrap and let steam. When the peppers are cool enough to touch, peel off the skins.</p>
			<p class="rp">Turn down the oven temperature to 300°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a gloved hand or the weight of a mug, push down and drain as much of the salty liquid as you can from the chiles and discard the liquid. You should have about 1½ cups of chopped chiles.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine the chiles and peppers in a food processor or blender and add the cumin, coriander, paprika, and lemon juice. Blend on medium speed until smooth. Then gradually drizzle in the remaining tablespoon oil and blend until the sauce comes together.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spread the sauce in a layer on a sheet tray and cook in the oven for 1 hour, stirring halfway through.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the cooked mixture resembles a thick paste, pour it into a sterilized 1-pint glass jar or deli container, pour additional oil over the surface to seal it, and cover.</p>
			<p class="rp">The paste can be stored in the jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.</p>

			<p class="rt">Lemon-Tahini Sauce</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 1 cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS CREAMY, NUTTY,</span> sour, salty, garlicky sauce is integral to everything. Okay, maybe not to <span class="i">everything</span> but certainly to many wonders of Arab cuisine. It’s easy to whip into a dipping sauce for falafel or thin with a bit of vinegar for salad dressing. Add some herbs, and it becomes a sauce for roasted fish. Mix with whole chickpeas, and you have a quick lunch to scoop up with vegetables. Its uses are endless. Enjoy this sauce with Falafel Mahshi (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_153">this page</a>) or as a condiment with Mashawi (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_182">this page</a>), slow-cooked lamb.</p>
			<p class="rilf">½ cup tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves, smashed and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, water, and lemon juice until combined and smooth.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the garlic and salt to create a garlic paste. Whisk rapidly until the sauce is the consistency of crepe batter. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">The sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" role="doc-pagebreak" title="40"/>days.</p>

				<p class="bxt">TARATOOR’S NON-NEWTONIAN QUALITIES</p>
				<p class="bx">Besides its versatility, the alchemy of taratoor is something of a miracle. When lemon’s citric acid cuts through the oils protecting the tiny dry protein particles in tahini, they seize up and harden in much the same way cornstarch and water combine to create oobleck, a non-Newtonian substance, meaning neither liquid nor solid—except taratoor is delicious and packed with nutrients! Not unlike oobleck, if your taratoor hardens, you can loosen it back up with a splash of cold water.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="ry">Makes 2 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">PERFECTED BY THE</span> Lebanese, this tangy, fluffy spread is quintessential to Lebanese street food. Toum goes beautifully with grilled and roasted meats—shawarma, kabobs, roast chicken—and is equally delicious with fries. My favorite place for toum is Zankou Chicken, a Lebanese Armenian–owned chain of Los Angeles restaurants, famous for its spit-roasted chicken. During hot summer days with my grandparents, someone inevitably would decide we needed a break from the kitchen and plan an excursion to Zankou. No one bothered with the menu. We were there for the perfectly cooked rotisserie chicken, enrobed in bright lemony toum and served in cigar-shaped pita rolls with some extra toum added on the side.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Some people say it’s the toum, not the meat, that makes the sandwich. Toum delivers the silkiness of aioli freed from the heaviness of egg yolk.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Just four ingredients and some ice water combine to make this magic. I perfected mine by searching out examples from Arab cooks and experimenting with technique. The secret, I found, is how you blend the ingredients in the emulsification process. Adding salt at the outset releases the garlic’s water and helps it form a paste. Icy cold water preserves the freshness and brings down the heat from the motor of the blender; this allows the garlic, lemon, salt, and water to whip into creamy goodness without changing the chemistry. Start with a fresh head of garlic; pre-peeled garlic becomes too strong as it ages.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 garlic head</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup ice water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon lemon zest</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups neutral oil, such as sunflower</p>
			<p class="rpf">Separate the cloves from the garlic head and then peel. Halve the cloves and dig out the sprouts and germs from the centers to further mellow their pungency.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine the garlic and salt in a food processor and pulse, scraping down the sides until they form a paste. (If this amount is too small for your processor, you can mince the cloves on a cutting board, then sprinkle salt on top, and use the side of your knife to smash the garlic into a paste.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the water, lemon juice, and zest to the food processor. Blend on medium speed until the mixture forms a white puree, about 3 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Gradually drizzle in the oil and continue mixing until the paste fluffs, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">The garlic spread can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="rt">Lemon-Garlic-Chile Relish</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about ¾ cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">TRADITIONALLY A LEMON-GARLIC</span> vinaigrette, this condiment helps brighten dishes with an intense hit of citrus and flavors. I love it as a garnish on Hummus (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_138">this page</a>) or Ful Madammas (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_151">this page</a>), and I often splash it by the spoonful as a finisher on flatbreads, especially in the spring when I bake fresh tender veggies like asparagus and favas onto my Mana’eesh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_77">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rhn">I’ve made this relish slightly less intense than the traditional version. When I can get it, I use green spring garlic for its milder, sweeter notes, and the rest of the year I blanch the cloves to tamp down the spice level. I also love to drizzle tatbeeleh over fresh herbs and fish like the Samaka Harra bil Tahini (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_197">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • For all the crudo and fresh-seafood lovers, this makes an excellent topping for raw fish or oysters.</p>

			<p class="rt">Onions Three Ways</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MANY OF MY </span>recipes require onions—lots and lots of onions. Not just as a base for stocks and sauces but as garnishes and pickles for various mezze dishes and meats. I also love to caramelize onions and fold them into dishes for extra sweetness. If you plan to tackle dishes such as Musakhan (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_173">this page</a>), Sayadiyah (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_195">this page</a>), or Mujaddarra (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_167">this page</a>), having ready-made caramelized onions comes in handy. My caramelized onion puree doubles as a sweet jam and can be used on charcuterie boards with cheese and bread or as a base condiment for a man’oushe (see <a href="c03.xhtml#page_77b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="r1t" id="page_43a">Caramelized Onions</p>
			<p class="r1y">Makes about 3½ cups</p>
			<p class="r1ilf">⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="r1il">3 yellow or white onions, thinly sliced into ¼-inch crescents (about 10 cups)</p>
			<p class="r1il">1½ teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="r1pf">Heat a large pan (a 10-inch cast-iron pan works perfectly for this) over high heat. When hot, add the oil and warm until shimmering.</p>
			<p class="r1p">Add the onions and stir to coat with the oil. Cook on high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring every minute or so to make sure the onions get to a deep golden color but don’t burn. Sprinkle in the salt and turn down the heat to medium. Spread the onions evenly over the pan and continue cooking, stirring occasionally.</p>
			<p class="r1p">Cook for 15 to 20 more minutes, stirring a few times in between. As the onion water evaporates, the onions should stick to the pan and start to brown. Allow the onions sufficient contact with the pan but stir before they burn. Continue stirring with increasing frequency as the onions soften and darken, until they turn a deep mahogany brown.</p>
			<p class="r1p">Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
			<p class="r1t" id="page_43b">Caramelized Onion Puree</p>

			<p class="rt">Fermented Red Hot Sauce</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about 2 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">LIKE VIETNAMESE GARLIC-CHILE</span> sauce or Indonesian sambal, this go-to condiment holds a special place on the Arab chile lovers’ table. Its secrets are time and good ingredients.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Shatta’s traditional sun-dried fermentation creates an acidity that rounds out the taste. Fellow Palestinian chef Abeer Najjar figured out that dehydrating chiles in an oven replicates the intense flavor that results from the traditional sun-dried method.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Removing the moisture primes the chiles for safe fermentation and a longer-lasting shatta. I cheat a little by adding vinegar to speed up the fermentation at room temperature. To ferment, you will need a 16-ounce sterilized jar. To sterilize, submerge the jar for 10 minutes in boiling water. Remove the jar with tongs and dry completely on a rack before use.</p>
			<p class="rhn">You can adjust the spice level by removing half of of the chile seeds or all of the seeds for a mild and tasty hot sauce. Handle the chiles with gloves if you have them. Otherwise, make sure to wash your hands between steps to keep the heat out of your eyes and nose. Speaking from experience, it’s not a mistake you’re likely to make twice (or once, if you can help it).</p>

			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons minced garlic (about 6 to 8 garlic cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>); optional</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">Extra-virgin olive oil to cover</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a food processor, pulse the chiles with the salt until you have a finely chopped, gritty paste. Spread the paste on the prepared tray and bake for 45 minutes, until most of the moisture has dried out.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small bowl, combine the paste, garlic, vinegar, Aleppo pepper, and sugar. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the mixture into the sterilized jar and pour in just enough oil to barely cover. Place cheesecloth or a coffee filter over the jar to cover. Allow to ferment in a draft-free spot away from direct sunlight. After at least 3 days, stir and taste with a clean spoon every day or two to check the flavor. I like to ferment mine for a week, but you can leave it to ferment for as long as you’d like, even for up to a year, under a thin layer of oil, in a sterilized jar.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once fermented to your liking, shatta will keep in the refrigerator indefinitely, where fermentation will still continue, slowly intensifying the flavor.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">PALESTINIAN COOKING BECOMES</span> increasingly spicy the farther south you travel. Gaza, where my mother’s family farmed citrus for generations, is where fresh chiles appear with most meals, often chopped into a salty lemon brine and speckled with herbs.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Cooks in my restaurant call it chimichurri. The two are similar, and many cultures have their own version of this herby spicy condiment. It’s a sauce that goes well on just about everything, from hummus to nachos.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This easy recipe blends up beautifully in one simple step and takes just minutes from start to finish.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 garlic cloves, crushed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 serrano chiles, stems, seeds, and veins removed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups coarsely chopped parsley, stems included (about 1½ bunches)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup coarsely chopped cilantro, stems included (about ½ bunch)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rpf">Combine all of the ingredients in a small blender or food processor on low to medium speed and puree until the mixture forms a thick pesto-like consistency flecked with herbs, about 30 seconds. If the mixture is too thick, add in more oil, a tablespoon at a time, until it’s smooth. Adjust salt to taste. Scrape into a shallow bowl to serve.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE SWISS ARMY</span> knife of preserved Arab foods, kishk is served as a topping on flatbreads, crumbled over salads as a formidable challenger to blue cheese, or dried and rehydrated into a musky base as a thickener for comforting stews. Kishk is a funky fermented mix of cracked wheat in milk or yogurt that can be used right away, preserved in olive oil, or dried, powdered, and reconstituted when food is scarce. Our culinary traditions for preserving dairy are another ingenious way Arabs can make something out of nothing and save seasonal bounty for leaner times.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I grew up knowing kishk as a yogurt-based man’oushe spread with an extra kick, but it comes in all textures, from a wet spread to a dry crumble. It is used as a base in several recipes in this book, such as in Salatet Shamandar wa Kishk (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_212">this page</a>) and Mana’eesh Bil Kishk (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_80">this page</a>), so I encourage you to stock up.</p>
			<p class="rhn">For a milder version, this recipe can be made a few hours ahead and crumbled fresh over salads or kneaded daily for up to a week: the longer it’s left to ferment, the headier the kishk.</p>
			<p class="rilf">⅔ cup bulgur #1 (fine size)</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup buttermilk</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup whole milk yogurt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium bowl, mix the bulgur with the buttermilk, yogurt, and salt until it’s well-incorporated and looks like oatmeal. Seal with plastic wrap and set away from direct sunlight in a cool draft-free place for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">The next day, hand-knead the mixture in the bowl. Replace the plastic wrap and leave to ferment for another 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">By the end of the third day, your “cheese” should develop a slightly fermented flavor and aroma. The kishk is ready once it’s firm enough to crumble between your fingers. If the funkiness is to your liking, it can be broken into crumbles to use right away or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For a muskier spread, it can be left, covered, at room temperature and kneaded daily for up to a week.</p>
			<p class="rp">If you want to keep it longer, spread your mixture on a sheet tray and bake on the oven’s lowest setting for 4 to 5 hours, or until it’s completely dried. Pulse the dried kishk in a food processor, until the shards reduce to a fine crumble.</p>
			<p class="rp">The kishk can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month or when dehydrated for up to 1 year. To rehydrate, add water, milk, or yogurt 1 tablespoon at a time until the consistency of the kishk is to your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak" title="48"/>liking.</p>
