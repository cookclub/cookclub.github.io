			<p class="pt">Vegetable Roots</p>
			<p class="cepi">One blistering cold night, home for winter break during my sophomore year of college, I startled myself awake with the realization that I would not be returning to school for the following semester. Shivering and exhausted, I made my way to the bathroom and took a hard look in the mirror. I was hollow cheeked, with fraying hair and sallow skin. I’d turned into someone I no longer recognized, and I hated the person I saw. I was tired of trying to disguise my decline with makeup, tired of straightening my curls to appear composed. My clothes drooped and sagged off my frame.</p>
			<p class="pf">I’d dropped to a skeletal 113 pounds, a weight dangerously below what was healthy for me. With no fat cells to shelter me and no emotional reserves for coping, doctors warned that my body had begun drawing from its organs to fuel its basic survival functions, taxing my kidney, liver, and heart. I had hit rock bottom.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203" role="doc-pagebreak" title="203"/>Unable to eat, I could feel the urgency of my decline. The only way to escape it, I realized, was to leave Massachusetts, leave school, leave my parents, and find a new course. Despite the illness, the thought of leaving school made me feel as if I were a failure. As a daughter of immigrants, leaving seemed unthinkable.</p>
			<p class="p">I don’t remember when I first felt as if I were falling into darkness. What I do remember is that I had often thought of college as a ticket away from escalating fights between my parents and my stressed-out teen (and preteen) sisters and toward a welcoming fold of students with backgrounds as varied as mine. At college, I planned to join the Arab Students Association and begin building community. I would find a place where I could finally belong.</p>
			<p class="p">However, it did not pan out that way. One Tuesday morning, my second week in college, I turned on the TV to see footage of one plane, and then another, flying into the Twin Towers in New York City. Panic overtook my body. I inhaled until my chest was full, sending up a silent prayer: “Please, God, let the hijackers be anything but Arab.”</p>
			<p class="p">Not long after that, American flags were being unfurled on every street corner, in front of homes, and on trees—they seemed to be everywhere, as far as the eye could see. Locked in my car for my daily one-and-a-half-hour commute between my family home and school, the twang of “Proud to Be an American” greeted me on every radio station.</p>
			<p class="p">This was not the Yankee Doodle patriotism of my childhood. It was jingoism, masking violent aggression that trickled down even to my liberal arts school. Later, during the war to come, two students from a nearby fraternity would accost my dear friend, an Arab Trinidadian, one night on campus, leaving him bloody and unconscious and taunting him as a “Saddam-loving sand n***er.” The university declined to call it a hate crime.</p>
			<p class="p">A few of the planes’ hijackers had been Lebanese, and curious classmates asked, “Aren’t your parents from Lebanon?” followed by, “I’m so sorry,” when I explained my family’s origins. Today, I wonder about that apology. Were they sorry for the backlash against Arabs in America? Sorry for my affiliation with an identity they now saw as negative? Sorry I’d drawn what they thought was a short stick, to be born Arab? I’m still not sure, but whatever their motive, receiving pity made me feel even more exposed. Even if I had still wanted to, blending in was no longer an option.</p>
			<p class="p">That same week, I found out my mother had filed for divorce. Over glazed holes at our local Dunkin’ Donuts, my father and I had a heated argument about who was at fault for the difficulties between him and my mother. I had internalized, as many children of divorce do, that I could somehow have helped keep the family together and that I had failed. It was years before he and I would talk openly again.</p>
			<p class="p">As anti-Arab sentiments, war rhetoric, death, and grief exploded in the world around me, my inner world imploded. I tried to find refuge by visiting family in Lebanon, Syria, and Greece during the summer of my freshman year. Even while there, amid beautiful settings, inhaling cedar in the mountains of Lebanon, or sitting down to a platter of perfectly charred octopus on a Greek Island, I was unable to loosen the anxiety that gripped my body.</p>
			<p class="p">I returned to school in the fall to learn that many of my Arab and Iranian classmates were stranded outside the country, banned from reentry. I would soon find out that the FBI had infiltrated our mosque, entrapping a childhood friend, who had been openly critical of the US government, in a surveillance sting operation, sentencing him <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204" role="doc-pagebreak" title="204"/>to seventeen years’ imprisonment. One day, government officials intercepted my father on his way to work and revoked his security clearance, ending a thirty-year engineering career on the premise that his familial ties to Syria posed a threat to America.</p>
			<p class="p">My stomach continued to feel worse and worse. The nausea would not go away. My body developed a muscle reflex, sending the food I swallowed back up. Even small meals felt like a Vegas buffet line dinner. Eating became a chore, and I relied on saltines and water to keep me going.</p>
			<p class="p">For months, doctors struggled to diagnose my mystery illness. As my weight dropped, classmates became suspicious that I was purposely denying myself food. Neither they nor I knew how to deal with my condition. Afraid of being judged, I kept to myself. My mother believed I’d picked up a parasite on my travels. The gastroenterologist called it severe acid reflux, and more tests showed damage to my esophagus. A nurse politely told me that she’d only ever seen these symptoms in people three times my age.</p>
			<p class="p">Angry with my body for betraying me, angry with a country uniting against me and my community, and angry with my parents who were waging an acrimonious divorce, I detached. In my detachment, I began overexercising to numb the pain and the loneliness. I remember the perverse pleasure I felt as my feet beat against the pavement and my muscles struggled against fatigue. In hindsight, I’m not sure if that pleasure came from punishing my body or feeling that I could control something in the midst of my helplessness.</p>
			<p class="p">When Ramadan rolled around that year, I stopped fasting for the first time since I’d begun a decade before. Even God, I felt, had betrayed me. Gradually, the rage turned inward and dissolved into depression.</p>
			<p class="p">I wanted to go away, the farther the better. My mother made a few calls, and soon, I was San Francisco–bound, taking the semester off to recuperate with my aunt Emily and uncle Eyad.</p>
			<p class="p">My uncle Eyad is my mother’s youngest brother. When I was three and he was sixteen, he arrived at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst to study electrical engineering. As a child who had dodged snipers on his way to school in Lebanon, he already had a vivid sense of which side of justice he was on.</p>
			<p class="p">One Thanksgiving Day, Eyad headed to Plymouth to express solidarity with Native Americans participating in a protest called Against the Mayflower, acknowledging that the <span class="i">Mayflower</span>’s arrival had been the beginning of a brutal end for the Wampanoag Tribe of Massachusetts. When my school took a field trip to Plymouth Rock to celebrate the pilgrims, my uncle pointed out that these same pilgrims had gifted the local tribes with smallpox-infected blankets in an act of germ warfare, seeding an early awareness of settler colonialism.</p>
			<p class="p">My aunt Emily is Jewish. She studied at Hampshire College, just up the road from Amherst, where she met my uncle, cooped up in the lobby of a building they’d taken over with a group protesting the university’s involvement in weapons research. Her activism extended to teach-ins she helped to organize in support of the Palestinian intifada and in opposition to Israel’s political ideology, Zionism, which denies Palestinians rights and excludes them from their own land. Her commitment to justice for Palestinians grew from the legacy of resistance to persecution on one side of her family and her dedication to challenging the history of Zionism on the other side of her family. Until meeting Emily, I had never met a Jewish person whose worldview transcended their ethnic identity. Through her, I began to consider that our identities could be composed of more than one <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205" role="doc-pagebreak" title="205"/>thing. The stories of my aunt and uncle’s first years together involved protests, paddy wagons, and rollicking debates at their local pizza hangout.</p>
			<p class="p">Emily grew up off the grid in California’s rural northern Humboldt County; my uncle, under Beirut’s bombardment. Her grandparents survived Russian pogroms (violent anti-Jewish riots); his fended off Jewish Zionist militia. And yet, the two found themselves more alike than different. Both came alive beneath the majesty of the redwoods and along the craggy bluffs of the Pacific. Both had a commitment to justice and gave their nights to political organizing, and both loved planning, preparing, eating, and sharing fresh, flavorful food. Their unlikely relationship and their shared love of cooking, activism, and nature turned out to be the perfect ingredients for my healing.</p>
			<p class="p">I should have been happy as I stepped off the plane in California; instead, wrapped in my heavy wool peacoat under the bright winter sun, I felt nothing. I answered my uncle’s greetings sullenly, with a yes or a no. “Yes, I’m okay.” “No, there’s nothing I want.” Sensing that I needed something to remind me of life’s pleasures, he headed straight to North Beach, San Francisco’s Italian neighborhood, for a taste of his favorite amoretti pignoli cookies, little pine nut–studded almond macaroons from Stella Pastry &amp; Café. Taking in the surrounding streets and shops, I felt as if I had stepped into an alternate universe: a glance was met with a smile or even a “Hello. How are you?” from strangers. Although it was still too painful for me to eat Stella’s cookies, I remember that spot every time I walk by it as the sweet start of my rebirth.</p>
			<p class="p">On the day after I arrived, my aunt asked if I’d like to go with her to Muir Woods, a legendary redwood grove north of San Francisco.</p>
			<p class="p">Confused, I asked her, “For what?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Just to walk around,” she said.</p>
			<p class="p">Walking in the woods eventually helped me become safe with my thoughts. Even though I had grown up next to Thoreau’s fabled woods, I had overlooked the “art of walking,” but now here, I came to love it. A steep trail connecting the woods to the beach along California’s wild craggy bluffs became a place my uncle and I would hike together, back when we were in shape. As we climbed Cardiac Hill, on the trail connecting the woods to the sea below, my uncle, a half-generation above me, treated me as an adult and his equal.</p>
			<p class="p">This meant that he challenged me often, and lovingly, with whys. Why did I use the term “we” to discuss US policy? Why did I avoid using “Arab” to describe myself? He worried that I had internalized a sense of inferiority while growing up in America, and he helped me explore my conflicting feelings. He introduced me to revolutionary psychiatrist Frantz Fanon, known for his work explaining the effects of colonization on our psyche. I kept Fanon’s book <span class="i">The Wretched of the Earth</span> within arm’s reach for several years, as I worked to unwind the fear and hostility that I felt toward myself and the world.</p>
			<p class="p">Soon, hiking turned into backpacking or, in the words of my aunt and uncle’s friends, “front-packing” trips. A good outing, they joked, meant that we’d consumed more than we burned. My aunt and uncle spent as much time planning and preparing food for these trips as they did on the trails themselves. Although still waif-thin and cautious, it was impossible not to get swept along in their food adventures. As my body started to ease into the pleasures of fresh air and tree canopies, I began to trust it more and ingest the medicine I so deeply needed—za’atar deviled eggs, fresh loaves of fougasse from a local bakery, sheep milk cheese, summer peaches, and homemade maple-sweetened granola bars, packed with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" role="doc-pagebreak" title="206"/>toasted almonds and pumpkin seeds. My healing had begun.</p>
			<p class="p">My aunt and uncle ran with a posse of South Asian transplants: activists, academics, and engineers like them. Amid the meals and riotous political talk, this was the first time I’d seen people so passionate about food. They were happy devoting a day or more to produce perfectly fragrant biryanis, coconut-laced vegetables, and delicate shrimp curries. In a twist that appealed to my feminist heart, it was the men in their circle, Jayanth, Shabi, and Ashok, who commandeered the kitchen while we women relaxed. On other evenings, my aunt and uncle and I met up with teams of activists in an effort to head off the country’s march toward war with Iraq. After the meetings, we’d gather for meals in San Francisco’s Mission District, the neighborhood where many years later I would open my second Reem’s location. We made the rounds to all of their favorite restaurants, and I finally recovered enough to feast with them long into the night on Pakwan’s Pakistani curries and Pancho Villa’s legendary burritos. Around the corner from our meeting place, Truly Mediterranean’s tiny walk-up counter churned out falafel and shawarma, layering in their trademark grilled eggplant and potato fries, grilled to crispy perfection in thin lavash wraps.</p>
			<p class="p">The day after George W. Bush declared war on Iraq, I attended my first high-risk direct action. My aunt and uncle coached me: “Take only your ID. Dress warmly. Jot the number of a lawyer on your arm with a Sharpie.” We ran ahead of the police, up an on-ramp to the Bay Bridge, blocking traffic between San Francisco and Oakland. As I took my first blow from a billy club, I remember feeling not only fear and pain but also the rush of being face-to-face with the might of the police. The power of our collective strength coursed through me. I was hooked. That evening, as my aunt boiled ravioli to toss over our salad, we talked about the energy we’d felt in the streets and, for the first time in a long time, I knew I would be okay.</p>
			<p class="p">I began to see a role for myself in the world, and, as my view widened, the cloud of sadness began to lift. I almost forgot what had brought me to San Francisco in the first place. I started to observe my uncle, who spent hours in the kitchen, obsessed with perfecting his technique for focaccia. He tested all the variables. Did the fog outside slow its rise? What might happen if he upped the salt and reduced the water slightly? Looking back, I realize that his science-inspired approach to cooking sparked my curiosity, and that, in and of itself, was new. I was no longer avoiding the kitchen. I wanted to hang out, smelling, tasting, and trying new things.</p>
			<p class="p">While my uncle was methodical, my aunt loved to improvise with seasonal vegetables. She was a Californian through and through. Their home was perched on a hillside in Daly City, where their kitchen faced the Pacific. A bookcase filled one wall, crammed with my aunt’s collection of cookbooks. Her go-to was Deborah Madison’s treatise on fresh simplicity: <span class="i">Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</span>. My aunt was an expert salad maker. She would wilt spinach by tossing it with sizzling seared mushrooms or substitute candied citrus peels and fried cheeses, when she ran out of fresh options. On weekends at a nearby farmers’ market, the city’s oldest, she would search for the first fava beans of the season, encased in silky fuzz. Where my mom’s beans had always endured a rigorous tumble in the pressure cooker to serve stewed, my aunt and I shed the fava’s outer pods, blanched the delicate, slightly sweet beans in a quick bath of salty water, and tossed them into salads—in the same way as I do now in Salatet Amah wa Ful Akhdar (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_217">this page</a>), my wheatberry-fava bean salad.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207" role="doc-pagebreak" title="207"/>What a departure from the tomato-cucumber salads I had grown up with, no matter the season. The unorthodox combinations were intriguing enough to spark my appetite and light enough to digest without discomfort. Every week, a new vegetable made its way into a marinade to toss over a salad or to chop into a stir-fry, soup, or omelet. My aunt’s sense of adventure and openness inspired me. To this day, despite a flicker of doubt I might feel about buying produce I don’t recognize, I still get a jolt of excitement when I see a new vegetable.</p>
			<p class="p">My aunt gently lured me into her cooking experiments. One day, while perusing bookstores on San Francisco’s Haight Street, the one-time center of the city’s counterculture movement, my aunt pulled from a shelf a slim volume of recipes that spanned from Turkey to Saudi Arabia and brought it to the register. When it came to Arab cooking, my aunt and I were equally lost, and we often turned to the book’s glossy photos of grilled, stewed, and roasted meats and vegetables for inspiration. Our first experiment was making a handsome dish from the Arabian Gulf: meat-stuffed onions in tamarind broth that was neither Californian nor Palestinian.</p>
			<p class="p">While the recipe we chose now seems random, it was a gateway to the wonder I began to experience each time I thumbed through a new cookbook. The more I learned about food in California, the closer it tracked the foods of my ancestors. Both Arab and Californian cuisine are all about seasonality. That spring, stalks of purslane, a small purply-green leafed vegetable, appeared in farmers’ markets. Purslane is the English word for <span class="i">baqla</span>, an Arabic name I’d often heard spoken with nostalgia while growing up. Purslane, it turns out, is a traditional ingredient in Salatet Fattoush (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_211">this page</a>), an Arab-style version of panzanella salad, and I now use it whenever it comes into season.</p>
			<p class="p">Poring over Deborah Madison’s collection, I gained a greater sense of my own origins, recognizing that I come from a people who live off the land. Gradually, I came to understand why many of the Arabs I know have to brave US Customs to smuggle in za’atar seeds for their home gardens. Through our food, we create home wherever we are. Discovering the parallels between foods in my new California home and the foods of my family’s past, as winter rolled into spring and eventually into summer, by experimenting with taste and texture, I tended to more than just my health: the process connected me with my roots.</p>
			<p class="p">I discovered that my own roots, although buried under years of distress, were still intact. Food not only reconnected me to my body but also connected me to the land on which I live. I now know that food can heal the traumas we experience collectively and the depression they cause. Being able to grow, eat, and share the foods connected to our land and ancestry repairs the parts of us that wither in the darkness. It makes us whole.</p>
			<p class="p">A perennial presence, the height of my depression returns each fall and stays with me throughout winter. With time, I’ve learned to befriend my depression. It is, after all, what led me to California. I rely on its inward pull, the shutting down I feel, to tell me when something is not right in my life. I now know that I am not alone. In my food and activist worlds, I’ve communed with others who share this path and who accept, rather than fight, the body’s response to the hurt we see in the world. As with the land we live on, it takes work to tend to our being. This work cannot be done alone. When we support one another to be our truest, fullest selves, we make the ground fertile for our liberation.</p>
