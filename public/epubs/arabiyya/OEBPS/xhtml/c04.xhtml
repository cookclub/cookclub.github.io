			<p class="rt">Clarified Butter</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 1½ cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">CLARIFIED BUTTER IS</span> a key ingredient in Arab pastries. Clarifying is the process of removing the water and milk-fat solids from the butter, yielding a richer, slightly nuttier taste.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Clarified butter provides not only deep flavor but also health and technical cooking benefits. Once the sugar, protein, and moisture are boiled and skimmed away, the butter can withstand higher cooking temperatures and longer cook times, allowing pastries like Ba’laawa bil Jowz (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_118">this page</a>) sufficient time to turn golden and bake through every layer without burning the top.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The process produces more of butter’s healthy fatty acids and removes the lactose, making it safer for most people with lactose intolerance. With its moisture removed, clarified butter lasts longer, adding it to the list of Arab food-preservation techniques. Also known as ghee in South Asian cooking, the butter takes easily to infusions of whole spices and dried herbs during the boiling process, enriching its flavor and adding further health benefits.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I love keeping the milk solids, browning them, and spreading them on toast for a special treat.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 pound unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small pot, melt the butter, barely bubbling, over medium-low heat, until foamy, about 20 minutes. Be careful not to let the butter boil or bubble aggressively because the milk solids could emulsify or start to brown. Using a fine-mesh skimmer or a wide flat spoon, periodically scoop the milk solids from the surface.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cover the mouth of a quart jar with a strainer and a layer of cheesecloth to catch any remaining milk solids and slowly pour the butterfat into the jar. Be careful to leave behind any extra water in the bottom of the pot; this looks like a milky white liquid. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">The milk solids can be recouped from the strainer and brushed on breads or vegetables as a delicate, sweet finisher.</p>
			<p class="rp">The butter can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 6 months or, refrigerated, for up to 1 year.</p>
			<p class="rst" id="page_97_anchor"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97" role="doc-pagebreak" title="97"/>ATTAR <span class="recipedot">•</span> <span class="arab-rt" lang="ar-SA" xml:lang="ar-SA"> قطر</span></p>
			<p class="rt">Blossom Syrup</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 2 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">ATTAR IS THE</span> signature ingredient that sweetens most Arab desserts and pastries. Orange blossoms and rose petals mingle to infuse this all-purpose syrup with the scent of springtime. In addition to the added flavor, lemon juice keeps the syrup from crystallizing.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In lieu of baking with sugar directly, Arabs often opt to control sweetness by drizzling and, in some cases, drenching pastries in this rich syrup. Pastries hot out of the oven are often met right away with syrup. My general rule of thumb on syrup: room-temperature syrup on hot pastry or hot syrup on cooled-down pastries but never cold on cold, since it will not absorb as well, and never hot on hot, since it may become mush.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Keep this syrup on hand for both the recipes in this chapter and for the recipes in the special occasion desserts chapter. It also mixes well as a simple syrup in cocktails, tea, and coffee.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon rose water</p>
			<p class="rpf">Combine the sugar, water, and lemon juice in a medium pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Decrease the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the syrup thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 7 minutes. Add the orange blossom and rose waters and cook for 3 minutes more. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">The syrup can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98" role="doc-pagebreak" title="98"/>months.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes twelve 2-inch squares</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE LICORICE SCENT</span> of anise and the citrusy orange play beautifully off the earthy spice notes of turmeric in this vibrant, sun-colored cake. Serving this family favorite reminds me of the ways my grandmother used to befriend neighbors and make community wherever she went. This Lebanese village cake spoke to her country roots, as she adapted to city life in Beirut.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The key to this cake’s delicate crumble is mixing just enough. Cutting the butter into the flour saturates the grain without activating the gluten: too much mixing, and the cake will become gummy. Greasing the pan with tahini instead of butter provides a nutty finish and a subtle heft to the bottom crust. If you don’t have tahini, butter works fine. The heartiness of the buttermilk makes this a good breakfast pastry, mid-afternoon snack, or a treat for guests.</p>
			<p class="rilf">Tahini or melted unsalted butter for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="ril">1 orange, sliced into ⅛-inch-thick rounds for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/300g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/240ml buttermilk</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup plus 2 tablespoons/150ml orange juice (about 4 small oranges)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/30ml orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/250g fine semolina flour</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups/300g plus 2 tablespoons/18g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/6g baking powder</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/4g ground turmeric</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/3g anise seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon/2g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/158g melted Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>), ghee, or vegetable oil</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch straight-sided baking pan with the tahini.</p>
			<p class="rp">Halve the orange rounds until you have 12 nice pieces. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, buttermilk, orange juice, and orange blossom water and mix until the sugar has dissolved.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl, combine the semolina flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, turmeric, anise seeds, and salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Slowly drizzle in the clarified butter. Use a fork or your hands to rub the butter into the flour mixture until the flour is fully saturated and forms fine crumbles. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and, with a mixing spoon or spatula, pour in the wet ingredients and mix until almost no lumps remain. (The batter will resemble cornbread.)</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Using the paddle attachment on low speed, slowly drizzle in the clarified butter, until the flour mixture is fully saturated and forms fine crumbles. Pour in the wet ingredients and mix until almost no lumps remain. (The batter will resemble cornbread.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Lay down three even vertical rows of four orange slices.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">The cake can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="rt">Tangy Coconut-Semolina Cake</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes twenty 3-inch squares</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">CRUSTY ON TOP,</span> delicate and crumbly in the center, this blossom-infused Arab favorite is as easy to make as it is gratifying to eat and serve. No wonder my grandma always had a stash on hand as an after-breakfast treat or post-swim pick-me-up.</p>
			<p class="rhn">During my pastry training, I churned out volumes of cakes, but what I quickly realized was these formal methods were not new, at least not to me. I remembered my grandmother’s cakes and in particular this namoura, something deeply traditional but also entirely expressive of my own tastes. I already knew how to make great pastry—my grandmother and our people had been doing it all along—and this settled in me a lingering uncertainty about where I belonged.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The namoura served in commercial bakeries is denser and sweeter than I prefer. My namoura draws on the flavors I love but also marries them with my pastry training: flour and eggs fluff up the center, while semolina flour forms a deeply satisfying crust, helping to soak up the blossom syrup. I added lemon zest to emphasize the subtle tang of the yogurt and reduced the sugar to heighten the coconut’s nutty profile.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This cake holds up well and can be made a day or two in advance and stored, covered, in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.</p>
			<p class="rilf">Tahini or melted unsalted butter for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="ril">4 eggs</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/145g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/335g labneh or whole milk Greek yogurt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/240g neutral oil, such as canola or sunflower</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/75g unsweetened shredded coconut</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/30ml orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="ril">1⅓ cups/180g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1⅛ cups/180g semolina flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/7g baking soda</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/5g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup/32g whole almonds, with skins</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/240ml cold Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9 by 13-inch straight-sided baking pan with the tahini.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl, combine the eggs and sugar.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Whisk the eggs and sugar vigorously until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, fold in the labneh, oil, coconut, orange blossom water, and lemon zest.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate medium bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, and salt. Sift the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients one-third at a time and fold in with the spatula until fully incorporated and no pockets of flour remain.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs and sugar on high speed until the mixture has tripled in size and is pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes. Decrease the speed to low and add the labneh, oil, coconut, orange blossom water, and lemon zest. Mix for 1 minute more until fully incorporated and no pockets of flour remain.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate medium bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients one-third at a time and mix on low speed until fully incorporated and no pockets of flour remain.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a rubber spatula, scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for about 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The top should be crusty and a deep golden brown.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the cake is baking, fill a kettle with water and place over high heat until boiling. Place the almonds in a heatproof bowl and pour the water over the almonds, leaving them to soak until cool. Once the almonds are cool enough to touch, drain the water and squeeze each nut between your fingers to pop them out of their skins.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the cake has finished cooking, let it rest for about 10 minutes on a wire rack. While it’s still hot, cut it into diamond-shaped pieces, four rows horizontally and five rows diagonally to make 20 pieces. (You will have some scrap pieces that make a good snack.) Press a skinless, hydrated whole almond or almond sliver in the center of each piece and seal them in by pouring the cold syrup over the hot cake, allowing the syrup to soak into the crevices and edges.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE ALEPPANS DESERVE</span> a place in the heart of all bread lovers for their delicately spiced and syrup-glazed take on the soft, puffy bread we know here as challah. This braided brioche is a treat served mainly during Ramadan.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Bread bakers over the ages have created fancier versions with dates and other fillings, but I opted for its simplest form because making it takes me back to my challah-braiding days at the worker-owned Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria. Every Friday, we would produce challah for the Sabbath. I became a pro at braiding dough—an afternoon weaving the long, soft ropes, alive with molecular activity, was therapy. When I discovered this Aleppan specialty, I was immediately hooked, not just for its proximity to challah (which I love), but for the way it incorporates two beautifully Arab ingredients—anise and sesame seeds—imparting a faint sweetness.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The secret ingredient that lends a nutty floral flavor to this bread is mahlab, adding a level of complex flavor to many breads in the region. Mahlab is the pulverized pit of a St. George cherry. It can be found in Arab grocery stores and is well worth having in your pantry if you want to bake the sweet breads and pastries in this book.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/11g active dry yeast</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ teaspoons/10g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/180ml whole milk, warmed to skin temperature (about 100°F)</p>
			<p class="ril">2¾ cups/385g all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/3g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/2g ground mahlab (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon/2g ground anise</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/50g whole milk yogurt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/50g melted unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ril">1 egg</p>
			<p class="ril">Neutral oil, such as canola or sunflower, for greasing the bowl</p>
			<p class="rilh">Egg Wash</p>
			<p class="ril">1 egg yolk</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/15ml heavy cream</p>
			<p class="rils">3 tablespoons/30g sesame seeds (I like a mix of black and white)</p>
			<p class="rilh">Syrup</p>
			<p class="ril">4 or 5 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/200g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup/120ml water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/5ml lemon juice</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the dough: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the milk. Mix until well incorporated and set aside in a draft-free place for 10 minutes or until foamy.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate small bowl, combine the flour, salt, mahlab, and anise.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Add the dry ingredients to a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the yeast mixture into the middle. Add the yogurt, butter, and egg in the well and mix the wet ingredients together until well incorporated. Slowly bring the flour into the middle and mix with your hands. You should have a shaggy, sticky dough. Using a bowl scraper or spatula, gently flip the loose, sticky dough onto a lightly floured work surface and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104" role="doc-pagebreak" title="104"/>knead for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, springs back when dimpled, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Combine the yeast mixture, yogurt, butter, and egg in the bowl and, using the paddle attachment, mix on medium speed until well incorporated. Switch to the dough hook, decrease the speed to low, and slowly pour in the dry ingredients. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 5 to 8 minutes, until the dough is shiny and elastic.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest in a warm draft-free place for 1 to 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the dough has risen, cut it into 3 pieces (about 252 grams each) and roll each piece into lengths about 16 inches long. Pinch the three ropes together at the top and braid the three strands. Pinch them together again at the other end.</p>
			<p class="rp">Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cradle the braided dough with your hands on both sides and transfer it to the prepared sheet tray. Gently brush the braid with the oil. Gently cover the braid with plastic wrap and allow it to proof for about 25 minutes or until the braid has doubled in size and the dough bounces back about halfway when indented with a finger poke.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the egg wash: Beat the egg yolk and cream together and brush it onto the dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle the seeds over the dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 15 to 18 minutes until golden brown.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the bread is baking, make the syrup: Crack the cardamom pods, pressing them on a hard surface with the flat side of a knife. In a small pot, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Add the lemon juice and cracked cardamom pods and simmer until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Make sure the syrup cools before you brush it over the bread.</p>
			<p class="rp">As soon as the bread comes out of the oven, place it on a wire rack and brush it with the syrup. Let cool and serve.</p>
			<p class="rp">The bread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days; thereafter, it makes lovely French toast.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • My general rule of thumb on syrup: cold on hot or hot on cold but never cold on cold, since it will not absorb as well, and never hot on hot, since it may become mush.</p>

				<p class="sbt">To Aleppo, With Love</p>
				<p class="sb">On my trip up the Syrian coast back in 2010, my father and I never made it to Aleppo. In Arabic, we call Aleppo “Halab.” Halab was the promised land for food lovers from the West and from the Arab world alike. One of the oldest cities in the world, Aleppo reigned as the heart of culture and food, packed with outdoor markets and produce and fed by surrounding acres of citrus groves and orchards. But more importantly, Aleppo’s rich gastronomic display was a result of the role it had played for generations as a refuge for the diverse range of Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, and Circassians who contributed their food traditions to this magical place.</p>
				<p class="sb">I speak of Aleppo in the past tense with tenderness because it no longer exists as it once did. The devastation of war has brought this magnificent city to its knees. I carry the stories from my father and our friends of the region’s specialty spots known only to locals—from sweet shops to expertly carved kebob spindles. The city was a gourmet destination indeed.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SAVORING MY FIRST</span> mouthful of pastry amid a burst of buttery flakes at the famous Panadería Rosetta in Mexico City, I knew instantly I had to make my own Arab version of this fruit and cheese confection. Like a croissant or kouign-amann, this crunchy, caramelized wonder is accomplished by repeatedly rolling and folding yeasted dough around the best butter you can find, until the gluten proteins dance their intricate dance with the sugars, salts, and fats to produce a delicately layered pastry whose complex molecular structure would make even a physicist proud. The name for this method is lamination, a process of alternating layers of dough and butter to create flakes of soft, delicate dough. I build an extra layer of depth into the flavor of this dough by creating a pre-ferment base called a poolish.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Anything wrapped in dough reminds me of the yeasted pastries we love in the Arab world; adding fruit and cheese to the mix kicks it over the top. We love cheese in our sweets! The Mexican guava paste I tasted in Mexico City reminded me of the perfumed jams we make from quince during the brief window when they reach their peak ripeness (see <a href="c08.xhtml#page_245">this page</a>). You can also buy these preserves in any Arab grocery store. If quince is unavailable, this recipe works equally well with any of your favorite fruit preserves, including kumquat, apricot, plum, cherry, and rose.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Luis, the head baker at Reem’s, descends from three generations of bakers from the Yucatan and rolls beautifully laminated dough that I could swear was baklava in its original form. I hope this pastry honors both his heritage and mine.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe takes patience and time (about 5 hours of inactive time); it’s great to make on a Sunday or spread over the course of a couple of days. If you decide to freeze your laminated dough between folds to make the rolls over more than one day, remember to leave ample time for the block of dough to thaw before it can be rolled again.</p>

			<p class="rpf"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106" role="doc-pagebreak" title="106"/>To make the poolish: In a small bowl, combine the water, flour, and yeast and mix with your hands or a spoon until it forms a batter. Let it sit, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours or in the refrigerator overnight. (If refrigerated, allow a half hour for the poolish to come to room temperature before you’re ready to make the dough.)</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the dough: Add the milk and yeast to the poolish, using a spoon to break it up, and then stir.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt and mix with a whisk or with your hands.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Make a well in the center of your bowl of dry ingredients and pour in the milk-poolish mixture. Using cupped fingers, pull the flour bit by bit from the sides. Squeeze handfuls and use the edge of your palm to squeegee the last bits, until the flour is fully incorporated. The dough should be wet and gooey. If it’s firm, add warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time (up to ¼ cup), until it loosens up. Let the dough sit, uncovered, for 15 minutes to relax. Using a bowl scraper or spatula, gently flip the loose, sticky dough onto a lightly floured work surface, knead for 5 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, springs back when dimpled, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: In the bowl of the stand mixer with the dough hook attached, add the milk, yeast, and poolish and mix at low speed, slowly incorporating the dry ingredients into the wet. The dough should be gooey but firm. If it is too firm, add warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time (up to ¼ cup), until it loosens up. When everything is incorporated, let the dough sit, uncovered, for 15 minutes to relax. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, springs back when dimpled, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">Form the dough into a ball. Then coat a large bowl with the oil and transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel and let it rise in a warm draft-free place for 1½ hours or until doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the butter block: While the dough is rising, place the butter pieces edge to edge between two pieces of parchment paper, forming a square, and pound it lightly with a rolling pin, until it softens and the pieces merge. Once the butter is malleable, roll it into an 8 by 10-inch block. Straighten up the sides with the edge of your palms. Using a small knife, cut and move any uneven edges to square-up any rounded corners. Keep the butter covered between two pieces of parchment and chill in the refrigerator.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a sheet tray and push with your hands or with a lightly floured rolling pin into a rectangular shape about 12 by 16 inches. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Take the butter block out of the refrigerator 10 to 15 minutes before using, so it is malleable and does not break into pieces when you roll it.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the dough from the freezer and position the widest side near you on a lightly floured surface. Remove the butter block from its parchment paper mold, and place it in the middle of the rectangle with the long side perpendicular to you, leaving 1 inch of dough above and below it.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108" role="doc-pagebreak" title="108"/>Fold over both sides toward the center so they cover the butter completely and then press the edges together to create a seam down the middle. Position the block with the narrow side facing you so you can roll in the direction of the open sides. Starting from the center each time, use a rolling pin to roll the dough up to the top edge and then down to the bottom, until it forms a long narrow rectangle nearly two-and-a-half times its original length, about 30 inches.</p>
			<div class="full_none">
				<img alt="" class="image" src="../images/14.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="rp">Rotate it 90 degrees and fold the dough, bringing the right side over the center and then the left side over it to the edge to create a trifold that is 8 by 10 inches.</p>
			<p class="rp">Return the dough to the freezer for 20 minutes to relax the gluten molecules.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the dough from the freezer and transfer it to your floured work surface. Repeat the rolling and folding process. Position the block so you can roll it toward its open sides. Roll it back out to nearly two-and-a-half times its size, rotate 90 degrees, fold it into thirds, cover in plastic wrap, and return it to the freezer to relax for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the dough from the freezer and repeat the rolling and folding a final time, then cover with plastic wrap and return the dough to the freezer to relax for another 20 minutes for one last time.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the egg wash: In a small bowl, beat the egg and cream together with a whisk or a fork. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the dough from the freezer and transfer to a floured work surface. Continue to add more flour to prevent sticking as you roll out the chilled dough to a 12 by 16-inch rectangle that is about ¼ inch thick. Cut away all four edges to reveal the lamination.</p>
			<p class="rp">Line a 13 by 18-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">To form your rolls, use a knife or bench scraper to divide the dough into eight equal strips. Tug gently at the ends to taper them. Wrap each strip around your fingers like a spiral phone cord, tucking in the ends to meet at the center and forming a ringed wall around a thin floor.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the rolls bottom side down, spaced at least 2 inches apart, on the prepared sheet tray.</p>

I stumbled on this delectable treat in Dearborn, Michigan, the promised land for Arab American foodies. I was on tour promoting <span class="i">We Are La Cocina</span>, a collection of stories and recipes with my sister entrepreneurs from La Cocina’s kitchen incubator program.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Our crew made our way to Qahwah House, a café that brewed every imaginable roast of Yemeni coffee, served in both modern pots and traditional rakwahs, tiny long-handled copper vessels, kept warm over a low candle. <span class="i">Qahwah</span> is the Arabic word for “coffee,” which originated in Yemen in the fourteenth century. A wall of photos showed the cultivation of coffee beans on the café owner’s family farm in Yemen. There was something familiar about walking into Qahwah House. As soon as I caught the fragrant scent of Arabic coffee, it transported me straight to my grandmother’s back patio. But what felt novel to me were the Yemeni pastries, which lined the front counter, fragrant with honey, another of Yemen’s celebrated ingredients. Every time I discover a new sweet from the Arab world, it makes me smile—how much I have yet to learn about the wondrous expansiveness of the region’s culinary arts.</p>

			<p class="ril">⅓ cup/80ml honey or Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup/80ml water</p>

			<p class="rilh">Topping</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup/60ml milk</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons/30g sesame seeds</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the dough: In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and a pinch of the sugar in ¼ cup of the milk. Mix until well incorporated and set aside in a draft-free place for 10 minutes or until foamy.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112" role="doc-pagebreak" title="112"/>To mix by hand: In a large bowl, combine the flour, the remaining sugar, and salt and mix until well incorporated.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate medium bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup milk, yogurt, and egg with the yeast mixture and whisk in the butter.</p>
			<p class="rp">Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour the milk-yeast mixture into the middle. Use a mixing spoon to slowly incorporate the dry into the wet and mix until it forms a shaggy, sticky mass. Using a bowl scraper or spatula, gently flip the loose, sticky dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, springs back when dimpled, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">To use a stand mixer: Pour the yeast mixture into the bowl with the remaining ½ cup milk, yogurt, and egg. Using the paddle attachment, mix until fully incorporated. Switch to the dough hook and on low speed, add the flour, the remaining sugar, and salt and mix. When the dough starts to look shaggy and comes together, add the butter. Increase the speed to medium and continue to mix for another 5 minutes, until the dough clings to the paddle and slaps the sides of the bowl. It should feel smooth and elastic.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest in a warm draft-free place for about an hour. When the dough completes its first rise, gently lift it out of the bowl and divide it into 6 pieces, then cut those 6 pieces into 6 pieces to create a total of 36 pieces (about 21 grams each).</p>
			<p class="rp">Line two 9-inch pans or one 16-inch round pan with parchment paper and rub thoroughly with oil.</p>
			<p class="rp">Shape each dough piece into rounds (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_62">this page</a>), then let the dough relax for 10 minutes. Use your fingers to flatten each round into a 2-inch-diameter disk. Place 1 teaspoon of mascarpone cheese at the center of each round. After all the rounds are topped, go back to the first round. Bunch the edges to envelop the cheese and pinch together to seal. Place edge side down in the center of the pans. Repeat the process, spacing the dough balls ½ inch apart, creating concentric circles. Stagger the balls to make a honeycomb-shaped formation.</p>

			<p class="rp">Once all the dough balls are filled and formed, cover with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for another 1 to 1½ hours. The dough balls should grow and just touch each other.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the dough is resting, make the syrup: In a small pot, combine the honey and water and heat until the honey is dissolved. Add the orange blossom and rose waters and lemon juice. Set aside to cool completely before using.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 375°F. Brush the dough with the milk and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. As soon as the cakes come out of the oven, drizzle with the cooled honey syrup.</p>
			<p class="rp">Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving. Slice into wedges and enjoy with your favorite tea or coffee.</p>
			<p class="rp">The cake can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • My general rule of thumb for syrup is cold on hot or hot on cold but never cold on cold, since it will not absorb as well, and never hot on hot, since it may become mush.</p>

				<p class="sbt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113" role="doc-pagebreak" title="113"/>Coffee Culture and Resistance</p>
				<p class="sb">Coffee and its rituals are a cornerstone of Arab hospitality. The first source for roasting the magical bean into a beverage dates back to Sufi monasteries in the south of Yemen five hundred years ago—two hundred years before beans from anywhere else made it onto the market. My first experience of this community was in Oakland’s Yemeni cafés, where coffee, bubbled to perfection in small copper pots, took center stage.</p>
				<p class="sb">I got to know more about the hardships Yemenis face through my work at the Arab Resource and Organizing Center. Working-class Yemenis make up a large part of the Arab community in Oakland and San Francisco. As Islamophobia climbed in the early years of the Trump administration and a new spate of racist violence targeted Arabs and Muslims, war deepened the world’s worst humanitarian crisis unfolding in Yemen.</p>
				<p class="sb">The Yemenis I’ve met bear scars both emotional and physical. Despite the involvement of the US government, the war receives little coverage here. Perhaps that’s part of the reason federal policies restricting Yemenis from sending remittances back home to family members receive almost no notice, even as famine and starvation spread rapidly. When the Muslim Ban prohibited travel, Yemenis were among the hardest hit; many US families were separated, and some were detained and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They took up the slogan “Banned and Bombed” to express the Yemeni experience in the United States.</p>
				<p class="sb">Local officials and civil rights groups denounced the policies, but the Yemeni community knew that to reverse the harm, they would also have to mobilize, organize, and build political power.</p>
				<p class="sb">I am inspired by the transformation I’ve seen in this community as a result of organizing, but I’m equally inspired by the way we can use ancient traditions of hospitality to create a sense of home away from home, here, even today. While we work to overturn harmful policies and provide support for a community suffering a humanitarian crisis, we can lift our spirits and remind ourselves of our innate power and the legacies that bind us.</p>

I learned to make these at Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria, a worker-owned bakery, where I landed my first professional baking position.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I took the morning shift, starting work hours before the sun rose to prepare hot sweet breads for early risers. I gradually pushed through my grogginess to develop speed and efficiency. I remember the early days, working alone in the morning silence, rolling out brioche to fill a whole butcher-block table and slathering it with melted butter, sugar, spices, and pecans. The sun would make its way to the window, lighting up the sugary mix with a golden glimmer.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My body found a rhythm to move with grace through rolling, cutting, weighing, and nesting swirls of dough one against the next. Those were healing days for me. The work took me out of my head and into my body. It was meditative. Being a baker not only fulfilled my yearning for connection to community, but it also guided me on a necessary path to rediscover myself and to deal with the trauma I had experienced in my body as an Arab in the diaspora.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • The caramel filling comes out bubbling hot and tempting, so be sure to let it cool just a bit, until the filling firms up enough not to drip or burn.

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE FIRST TIME</span> I saw bakers making phyllo dough, it was life changing. I’d returned from a trip to the Arab world with my dad, where I had obsessively tracked down every bakery I could find. One fall, while visiting my father outside of Boston, he and I went to Watertown, or as we called it—little Armenia—where countless Lebanese Armenian bakeries had set up shop. We stumbled upon a small bakery in a shopping plaza with a big sign that read: Voted Best Baklava in Boston!</p>
			<p class="rhn">On the day we wandered in, a young woman about my age and a man who looked to be her father stood on opposite sides of an enormous six-foot butcher block, engrossed in the task at hand: stretching a sheet of spectacularly thin dough. Watching the process fascinated me, but it was the product itself that rocked my world. Theirs was an ultra-delicate, soft, delicious dough, layered around nuts and sweet fillings. How was it, I wondered, they could create a dough this soft and yet so strong that it never ripped when stretched thin?</p>
			<p class="rhn">The difference between this house-made dough and the shipped-in-boxes of stuff I’d had before was like night and day. I silently vowed that one day I would feature this homemade dough in my own bakery. It turns out that it’s harder to make than it looks, and it’s taken generations, descending from the Ottoman Empire, to perfect the skill of making this dough.</p>
			<p class="rhn">If you feel inclined, give making it a try! You might discover a natural-born skill. And if you do, it will set your baklava apart a million times over.</p>

			<p class="rpf">To mix by hand: In a medium bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and then pour the water, oil, and vinegar into the middle. Slowly bring the flour into the middle and mix with your hands. You should have a shaggy dough that comes together. Using a bowl scraper or spatula, gently flip the loose dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes. Your dough should be strong and stretch like a windowpane without ripping.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Combine the flour, salt, water, oil, and vinegar in the bowl. Using the dough hook, mix on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until it comes together. Increase the speed to medium and mix for another 5 minutes, until you hear the dough slap the sides of the bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a dish towel, and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. This will allow the dough to become elastic and make it easier to work with during the next steps.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the cornstarch in a wide bowl. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" role="doc-pagebreak" title="117"/>To roll out the dough: When the dough is well rested, divide it into 20 pieces (about 70 grams each). Roll the pieces into small balls and cover them with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel to prevent drying.</p>
			<p class="rp">Work with only 5 pieces at a time and place the rest of the dough in the refrigerator. Dip the first piece of dough in the cornstarch. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 5-inch disk about ⅛ inch thick, rotating 45 degrees with each turn, then set aside. Repeat the same process with the remaining 4 pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a fine-mesh sieve, lightly dust the five disks with a teaspoon of cornstarch each. Stack the disks and, with a flat (not tapered) rolling pin, very gently and slowly roll out the sheets, rotating them 90 degrees every so often, until the sheets are about 12 inches wide by 17 inches long. If the layers begin to stick together, take a moment to dust with more cornstarch between them. Transfer and restack the five sheets of phyllo onto parchment paper, re-dusting each layer with cornstarch, and cover with another piece of parchment paper to prevent drying. Place them in the freezer and repeat this process four more times, until you’ve rolled out all 20 pieces of dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">To store: Stack all four batches in their parchment dividers, loosely roll (don’t press tightly) the entire stack, and slip the whole thing into a resealable bag or wrap thoroughly in plastic wrap. Freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to use, thaw in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for a few hours.</p>

				<p class="sbt">Finding the Best Phyllo</p>
				<p class="sb">Not all phyllo is created equally. The key to a good phyllo is sufficient oil content to keep it soft but sufficient strength to prevent breakage with handling. The ratio of flour-to-fat content also affects the browning. I like a dough that holds its shape and doesn’t break apart when it flakes and yet remains delicate to the bite. A great dough browns evenly but doesn’t get so crispy that it shatters with handling or, more importantly, when it’s being eaten. You can find phyllo in the frozen section of most grocery stores. My favorite brand is Kronos because of its delicate texture; it has served us well at Reem’s.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 24 pieces</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">WHEN I FIRST</span> opened Reem’s, I wanted to be an exclusively savory bread bakery. But then I started getting the million-dollar question: “What about baklava?” The Greek version is well-loved and assimilated in the American palate; its square shape, with cinnamon-spiced walnuts, is the relatable guy next door.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I knew I wanted to make baklava to rival the best I’d ever tasted. With its delicate pastry-like flakes, crisped in clarified butter, its layers held to one another with blossom-scented syrup and sandwiching a spiced-nut crumble, baklava had served as a cultural emissary of my childhood. Sharing it made me feel accepted.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Ba’laawa, the Arabic word for baklava, can be stuffed with a range of fillings, and I offer some of my favorites here and in the next few recipes. Making ba’laawa is straightforward, and, once you find your groove, painting each sheet in broad strokes with melted butter can be meditative, even therapeutic.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Two things are essential for the success of this dish: clarified butter to allow the sheets of dough to crisp and reach a golden brown without burning and cooled syrup poured onto hot-from-the-oven pastry. Cooled syrup preserves the flaky texture, averting the sogginess in some commercially produced ba’laawa.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I sometimes joke that ba’laawa embodies my spirit: it’s delicately layered, nutty, and sweet—and it can easily be buttered up.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups walnuts</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon rose water</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 recipe Hand-Rolled Phyllo Dough (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_116">this page</a>) or 1 package store-bought phyllo dough, defrosted and at room temperature</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup melted Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or ghee, plus more for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="ril"><span class="frac">1 cup</span> Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9 by 13-inch sheet tray with parchment paper. Using a pastry brush, coat the parchment and sides of pan with melted clarified butter.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: In a food processor, combine the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon and pulse to a fine crumble. Drizzle in the orange blossom and rose waters and pulse a few more times, until the mixture dampens. Do not overblend or the crumble will form a paste. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To prepare the dough: Unroll the phyllo dough on a cutting board or work surface. Using a sharp butcher knife, cut the dough in half, splitting the long side down the middle to make forty 8½ by 12-inch sheets. Stack one on top of the other and cover with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel to prevent drying.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble the baklava: Start with one stack and form the base of the pastry by layering the dough, one sheet at a time, onto the prepared sheet tray and brush each sheet from edge to edge with the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" role="doc-pagebreak" title="119"/>melted butter. (Note: If using hand-rolled phyllo, you may need to gently brush away any excess cornstarch/flour mixture from the dough.) The first few layers may tear when brushing, so drizzle rather than brush on about a tablespoon of melted butter instead. When you have layered twenty sheets, sprinkle the nut filling evenly across it and lightly pat the filling down. Layer and brush the second stack of twenty dough sheets to form the top crust of the pastry. Place the tray in the refrigerator to chill the dough for about 20 minutes to help everything set before cutting.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the tray from the refrigerator and, using a sharp knife, cut the dough (still in the pan) as follows: make two vertical and three horizontal cuts to divide the pastry into twelve evenly-sized squares. Next, make diagonal corner-to-corner cuts, dividing the squares into twenty-four triangles; take care to cut all the way through. Spoon the remaining melted butter over the pastry and into the crevices.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the baklava is baking, prepare the syrup and set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the baklava from the oven and pour the syrup evenly over the top. Let the baklava cool and serve at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">The baklava can be stored in an airtight container, layered between wax or parchment paper, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Enjoy cold or at room temperature.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 40 small nests</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IS IT POSSIBLE</span> to love a recipe simply for its name? These delicacies are as cute as the creation they imitate. They’re formed by wrapping coiled phyllo dough around bright green candied pistachios (in this case, in the form of a paste). My fondest memories of these sweets come from Shatila Bakery in Dearborn, Michigan, the promised land for Arabs in America. Every year we were sent one of their iconic red boxes of baklava sweets, and sure enough, I would find these little birds’ nests waiting for me.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I use a pistachio paste to make up the center, but these can be filled with virtually any sweet treat, including pastry cream, chocolate, or other candied nuts.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • To form and scrunch the rolls, you will need a ¼-inch wooden dowel. When I don’t have a dowel on hand, I tape two chopsticks together to extend past the widest part of the phyllo dough.</p>

			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9 by 13-inch sheet tray with parchment paper. Using a pastry brush, coat the parchment with melted butter.</p>
			<p class="rp">To prepare the dough: Unroll the phyllo dough on a cutting board or work surface with the short side facing you. With a sharp knife, score the dough down the middle to make 40 long pieces. Stack one on top of each other and cover with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel to prevent drying.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121" role="doc-pagebreak" title="121"/>To assemble the nests: Place one sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface with the shorter side facing you. Lightly brush the butter across the top, center, and bottom of the phyllo sheet.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fold the edge of the phyllo closest to you up to 1 inch below the top edge. Place the dowel on the bottom folded edge, align the end of the dowel to the left edge of the phyllo, and begin to loosely roll the phyllo around the dowel, stopping at the inch of extra dough. Lift the dowel and gently scrunch the phyllo, accordion-style, to the left end. Slide it off the dowel and gently shape it into a circle, with the reserved inch of phyllo forming the center of the nest. Your nest should resemble a scrunchie. Place the nest on the sheet tray. Repeat with the remaining sheets of phyllo, placing them close together but not touching. Bake until lightly golden, about 15 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122" role="doc-pagebreak" title="122"/>minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the paste: While the nests are baking, combine the pistachios, sugar, orange blossom water, and syrup in a food processor and blend until it forms a nice smooth paste; add more syrup if it seems too dry.</p>
			<p class="rp">After the nests come out of the oven, place a teaspoon of paste in each center and drench with the remaining syrup. Let the nests cool and serve at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">The nests can be stored in an airtight container, layered between wax or parchment paper, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Enjoy cold or at room temperature.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 40 rolls</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">BAKLAVA, HAPPILY, CAN</span> take many shapes. The name for one of the most popular, asaabe’, translates to “fingers” in Arabic. These rolls are scrunched to create fine ridges for a maximum wow effect, lined up side by side in a tray, baked, and then bathed in a milky syrup.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This dessert is loosely based on a baklava called sütlü nuriye that I once saw in a Turkish bakery. It’s a version of baklava made lighter by thinning the sugar syrup with milk. I loved the milky texture with the hazelnut. In this recipe, I added praline to the hazelnut mixture and swapped honey for sugar in the syrup to add depth.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In one version of the dessert’s history, a price ceiling on baklava, imposed in the aftermath of a Turkish military coup in the 1980s, raised the cost of producing traditional pistachio-filled baklava, forcing the closure of many baklava shops in Istanbul. But one shopkeeper was determined not to close down because of that; instead, he created a new type of baklava and substituted hazelnuts for the pistachios to make a cheaper but equally delicious alternative. His invention caught on, and it remained in the baklava arsenal when shops reopened and the regulations were lifted. Stories like this remind me of the resilience people in this region have and the creative deliciousness they can produce, even in the face of adversity.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • To form and scrunch the rolls, you will need a ¼-inch dowel. When I don’t have a dowel on hand, I tape two chopsticks together to extend past the widest part of the phyllo dough.</p>

			<p class="rilh">Syrup</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup honey</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spread the hazelnuts evenly on a sheet tray and toast for 10 minutes or until golden. Remove the sheet tray from the oven and rub the nuts in a dish towel to remove their skins. Skip this step if the hazelnuts are pre-blanched. Remove any remnants of skins from the tray and return the nuts to the tray.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar with the water. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar has melted and turns a deep amber color. Pour the caramel mixture over the nuts on the sheet tray and let them cool completely to harden, about 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Break the nut brittle into the bowl of a food processor and pulse to a fine crumble. Take care not to overblend or the crumble will form a paste. Reserve ¼ cup for garnish.</p>
			<p class="rp">Line a 9 by 13-inch sheet tray with parchment paper. Using a pastry brush, coat the parchment with melted butter.</p>
			<p class="rp">To prepare the dough: Unroll the phyllo dough on a cutting board or clean work surface. Using a sharp butcher knife, cut the dough in half lengthwise to make two equal stacks. Cover the stacks with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel to prevent drying.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble the baklava: Position one sheet with the widest side (about 17 inches) facing you and brush with the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top and, again, brush with butter. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the hazelnut brittle.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dowel at the end facing you (widest) and roll the layered phyllo gently all the way up. Place a hand on each end of the rolled phyllo and gently push both ends toward the center to scrunch like an accordion. Slide the scrunched roll off the dowel and place on the narrow end of the prepared sheet tray. Repeat this process until all of the dough has been scrunched into lines of rolls. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to help everything set before cutting.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124" role="doc-pagebreak" title="124"/>Remove the tray from the refrigerator and, using a sharp knife, cut the shaggy ends to create clean edges. Then cut the rows into fourths. Line up the pieces: you should have four columns of ten rows each for a total of 40 pieces. The rows may be touching, and that’s okay. Pour the remaining butter over the crevices.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the rolls are crisp and deep golden brown. Let the rolls cool to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the rolls are cooling, prepare the milk syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the milk and honey and bring to a boil, stirring until the honey dissolves. Once bubbles form, turn the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the orange blossom water and remove from the heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the hot milk syrup over the pan of rolls and allow them to soak up the syrup for at least 30 minutes, then sprinkle with the reserved hazelnut brittle and serve.</p>

Ultra-chewy in the center, crispy on the edges, and topped with toasted sesame seeds, flecks of halawa candy, and salt flakes, these cookies will seem original and, at the same time, deeply familiar. If you’re looking for a way to impress a vegan friend, the search is over.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Halawa is the Arabic name for the tahini-based candy known in the United States as halvah. It’s a crumbly melt-in-your-mouth sesame fudge, dating back thousands of years all the way to the Byzantine period, originating in present-day Istanbul. A thirteenth-century book on Arab cookery, <span class="i">Kitab al-Tabikh</span>, documents seven different variations of this beloved treat. You can have fun with halawa, swirling in nuts, chocolate, or dried fruit.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • To make a good halawa, you need to make correct candy syrup. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, place a bowl of iced water next to your syrup. After a few minutes of boiling, test the syrup by placing a spoonful in your water. It is at the right stage when it forms a firm ball that can be rolled between your fingers and is slightly malleable when you squeeze it.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Crumble</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/258g tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon/2g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/150g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons/44ml water</p>
			<p class="rils">¼ cup/40g sesame seeds</p>
			<p class="rilh">Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">2¾ cups plus 2 tablespoons/400g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ teaspoons/9g baking powder</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/6g baking soda</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons/6g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups/340g packed light brown sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">⅔ cup/144g coconut oil at room temperature (melt if mixing by hand)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup/120ml oat milk</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons/10ml vanilla extract</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/160g 70% dark chocolate, coarsely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/3g Maldon salt (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the crumble: Stir the tahini well and then combine with the kosher salt in a heatproof bowl. (Wrap a damp dish towel into a little nest and place beneath the bowl on a countertop to make stirring easier.)</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small pot, combine the sugar and water over medium heat and stir continuously. Using a candy thermometer, take the temperature of the mixture. When it reaches 250°F, carefully drizzle the syrup into the tahini, while stirring the mixture constantly using a wooden spoon. Continue stirring until the tahini begins to look grainy and becomes difficult to stir, then on a tray spread in a ¼-inch layer, and allow to cool to room temperature. The mixture should look crackly on top and become dry to the touch, almost like fudge. Cool to harden slightly and then break it with your hands into small crumbles (around the size of chocolate chip morsels). You should have about 3 cups of the crumble. Reserve 1 cup for the topping.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">On a small sheet tray, toast the sesame seeds for about 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Increase the oven temperature to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl, combine the brown sugar and coconut oil and, with the mixer on medium speed or with a mixing spoon, cream until homogenous, about 5 minutes. Add the milk and vanilla and mix until thoroughly combined. Gradually add the flour mixture to avoid spatter and mix until well incorporated. Fold in the crumble and the chocolate.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126" role="doc-pagebreak" title="126"/>Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat.</p>
			<p class="rp">To form the cookies: Using a 2-ounce scoop, portion the dough (each should be about the size of a golf ball), and set 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Refrigerate for 10 minutes to chill to help the cookies keep their shape when they bake.</p>
			<p class="rp">After the dough has chilled, coat the top of each cookie with a sprinkling of the reserved crumble, ½ teaspoon of the sesame seeds, and a pinch of Maldon salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 14 to 16 minutes, rotating the pan after 7 minutes, until the cookies are crisp on the edges and soft but not raw in the center. Let cool completely.</p>
			<p class="rp">The cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. These cookies can be frozen and thawed when ready to enjoy.</p>

			<p class="ryno">Makes 36 donut holes</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I KNOW I</span> am not alone in my obsession with donuts. My favorites are the little donut holes; in just a bite or two, the only evidence remaining is a trace of glaze or sprinkles on my fingers.</p>
			<p class="rhn">While growing up, I never missed the chance to indulge in the cider donuts from nearby farms during apple-picking season or the donut holes saved for me by the cashier at the Dunkin’ Donuts near my college campus. I’d buy up bags of Munchkins and freeze them for late-night snacks.</p>
			<p class="rhn">When I travel, I love tasting different renditions of fried dough. Inspired by the beignets at New Orleans’ famous Café Du Monde, I set about making a donut hole I would love. After much experimenting, I got a dough with a texture that falls somewhere between pancake batter and a brioche dough.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Scoop these into donut holes with whatever spoon you have on hand or shape them with an ice cream scoop. The donut holes will double in size. I would encourage you to use the weight measurements, since the final product will then be closer to the intended result than if you use the volume measurements. If you don’t have a scale, that’s okay. Just pay attention to the textural clues in the recipe.</p>

			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/6g active dry yeast</p>
			<p class="ril">2¼ cups/315g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/25g granulated sugar</p>

			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2ml orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="rilh">Sprinkles</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup/61g granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/2g ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/1g ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/1g ground anise</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon/0.5g ground nutmeg</p>
			<p class="ril">⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</p>
			<p class="rils">Neutral oil, such as sunflower, for frying and coating the scoop</p>
			<p class="rpf">Line a 13 by 18-inch sheet tray with paper towels. Set a wire rack over a second sheet tray.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine the milk with the yeast and set aside in a draft-free space for 10 minutes or until foamy.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour the yeast mixture into the middle. Add the eggs and butter. With your hand, slowly work the flour into the wet mixture to create a thick batter. Embrace the gooey strands sticking to your fingers as you activate the gluten. Use the outer edge of your hand or a bowl scraper to scrape and fold the batter in on itself for about 5 minutes, turning the bowl a quarter rotation with each fold.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Combine the yeast mixture with the flour, granulated sugar, salt, eggs, and butter in the bowl. Using the paddle attachment, mix on medium-low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Mix until ribbons or strands form a batter-like dough and begin to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature for 1½ hours in a warm draft-free place or refrigerate overnight. It will bubble up, creating a wet dough that makes long strands if you lift a finger full of it from the bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the glaze: Combine the confectioners’ sugar, water, lemon juice, and orange blossom water in a shallow bowl. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the sprinkles: Combine the granulated sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, anise, nutmeg, and cloves in a shallow bowl. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To fry the donut holes: Fill a medium pot with about 4 inches of oil or enough to immerse the donut holes. Heat the oil over medium-high heat (350°F) until hot but not smoking. A droplet of batter should sizzle instantly when it hits the oil.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fill a small bowl with enough oil to coat an ice cream scoop between uses.</p>
			<p class="rp">Scoop balls of dough, about an inch in diameter, into the hot oil. Leave some space for the donut holes to bounce around and fry in batches one layer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129" role="doc-pagebreak" title="129"/>at a time. After about a minute, flip with a slotted spoon or tongs and cook for another minute. When they’re done, the donut holes will be evenly brown and feel much lighter than they look. A toothpick pierced through the center should come out clean.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a slotted spoon or tongs, lift the donut holes from the fryer and place on the prepared baking sheet. Scoop the next batch into the oil. While the next batch is frying, use tongs to twirl and flip each donut in the bowls of glaze and sprinkles and then transfer to the wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. Donuts can be stored in an airtight container at room temp for up to 2 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130" role="doc-pagebreak" title="130"/>days.</p>
