			<p class="rt">Chickpea-Tahini Spread</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about 1½ cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">LEARNING TO MAKE</span> great hummus requires tasting along the way and trusting what you taste. My grandmother knew just what she was looking for when she made hummus, but she still called me over to ask my opinion, feeding me the answers she wanted: “Do you think it needs a little more lemon?” We’d squeeze another half of a lemon into the mix. “Do you think it has enough salt?” She’d pour a half-teaspoon into my palm to tip into the food processor…and we’d taste it again. Round and round we’d go, adding and tasting, thinning it with broth from the beans as needed, until everyone agreed it was perfect.</p>
			<p class="rhn">For my grandmother, recipe portions were a starting point, but her real secret to perfect hummus came from pouring in dabs of lemon and tahini. She’d adjust the amounts, depending on how flavorful and ripe her lemons were. And she never skimped on the tahini.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In my grandmother’s time, to get the smoothest-textured hummus, cooks used to rub the boiled beans together to remove the skins. Today, with powerful food processors, few people take this step. In my restaurant, I boil the beans, rub them together with my hands, and pour off the skins that float to the top several times. This process, for me, is meditative and produces a creamier result.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My grandmother’s method, layering in the ingredients, is the one I still use. The hummus continues to form its taste and texture long after it’s left the blender. The lemon’s acid binds with the tahini to thicken the spread, and any hummus that goes into the fridge emerges thicker and filled with a garlic-infused bloom. If you need to, thin it with ice water and restore the texture to your liking with a whisk or a spoon.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This hummus recipe can be used as the base for Hummus bil Awarma (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_139">this page</a>); as a nice vegan platform for Tatbeeleh (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_42">this page</a>), a lemon-chile relish; or for the classic dish Qudsiyah by spooning Ful Madammas (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_151">this page</a>), stewed fava beans, on top.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is perfect for a two-person household but easily doubles or triples for a family or a party.</p>
			<p class="rilf">¾ cup dried chickpeas, or one 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon baking soda (for dried chickpeas only)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">5 tablespoons lemon juice (about 2 lemons), plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup ice water, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon sumac for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>) for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">If using dried chickpeas, soak the chickpeas overnight or for at least 12 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">Drain the chickpeas, place them in a small pot with the baking soda, and cover the beans with about 6 inches of clean water. Bring to a boil, skim, discard the residue from the water’s surface, and decrease the heat to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, uncovered, until the beans soften, about 30 minutes. Test for doneness by squeezing a bean between your thumb and forefinger. A perfect bean crushes easily but does not turn to mush. Drain in a colander when done cooking.</p>
			<p class="rp">Immerse the beans in a bowl of cold water and rub between your palms, pouring off any skins that float to the surface. Drain and repeat two or three times. If using canned chickpeas, repeat the same step, rubbing off as many skins as you can. Reserve 2 tablespoons for garnish.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine the remaining chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, and salt in a food processor and pulse. Add the ice water. Blend at high speed for 5 minutes, until no lumps remain. (Yes, that’s right, for 5 minutes. Set a timer and walk away.) At the 5-minute mark, slowly drizzle the tahini into the mixture on medium speed. The mix should be airy and form stiff peaks. If it’s the texture of ice cream, it’s too thick, so add additional ice water, as needed. Adjust the lemon juice and salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, scoop the hummus onto a plate or into a shallow bowl. Use the back of a spoon to form a moat between the outer edge and the center. Drizzle your canvas copiously with olive oil and garnish decoratively with the reserved whole chickpeas, sumac, and Aleppo pepper. Hummus can be stored, ungarnished, in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
			<div class="sbbox">
				<p class="sbt">Loaded Hummus (and I Don’t Just Mean the Awarma on It)</p>
				<p class="sb">I’m going to fill you in on a little secret: if it don’t got chickpeas, it ain’t hummus. The word <i>hummus</i> means “chickpea” in Arabic—not “dip.” Calling it black bean hummus is like calling a hamburger ham. You can understand how someone might make that mistake, but you know the instant you hear it that it’s wrong. If you want to have fun with flavors, you can add tahini and lemon to just about any vegetable and call it mutabal (see beginning on <a href="c05.xhtml#page_146">this page</a>); just don’t call it hummus.</p>
				<p class="sb">Maybe the sensitivity I and many Arabs feel about hummus has to do with the way we’ve been cut out of a food story so integral to our culture. Hummus has become synonymous with Israeli food in America (the Israeli company Sabra has more than 60 percent of the market share for hummus in the United States), even though the origins of hummus likely stretch back to Egypt.</p>
				<p class="sb">The real test for me comes in a too-familiar discomfort that starts deep in my belly when a customer praises my hummus, saying it reminds them of Israel. I’m expected to affirm their experience and create a connection between us, but that affirmation makes me feel invisible. In that story, Palestinians are cast in a supporting role, affirming an Israeli story, and requiring me to shrink and disappear.</p>
				<p class="sb">There is also the harmful idea of “hummus kumbaya,” a phrase my friend, Palestinian cookbook author Leila Haddad, uses to describe the idea that eating hummus somehow diminishes our differences. Israelis may make and eat hummus the same way we do, but it doesn’t make us the same if Palestinians are denied basic rights like land-ownership, freedom, and basic human dignity that Israelis afford themselves.</p>
				<p class="sb">Yes, we all eat hummus, but that doesn’t negate occupation and apartheid. Enjoying our foods while rejecting our right to exist is why Palestinians have fought for ownership of our foods in the face of Israel’s infusion of millions of “gastrodiplomacy dollars” to make the appropriation of Palestinian foods seem normal and commonplace. Our food is an assertion of our existence and our connection to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" role="doc-pagebreak" title="140"/>land.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IT’S HARD TO</span> keep from snacking on the choicest shreds of this gorgeous confit of crispy lamb breast. That cut is the fattiest part of the lamb, and slow-roasting it allows it to cook in its own fat and become moist and tender. Harvest the spice-steeped lamb fat into a glass jar to use later for spectacular home fries or roasted vegetables.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Lamb breast is a specialty cut of meat, but it’s well worth it. The most flavorful parts of the lamb lie between the tissue of the breast. You will most likely have to special order it from the butcher. If you have a hard time sourcing breast, lamb shoulder chops make a great substitute, either bone-in or deboned. You may need to extend the cooking time if the shoulder is cut more than 1 inch thick.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>), plus more for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ pounds lamb breast or shoulder, cut into 1-inch-thick slices</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower</p>
			<p class="ril">1 recipe Chickpea-Tahini Spread (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_138">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small bowl, whisk together the salt, spice mix, and oil to make a viscous paste. On a small sheet tray, rub the lamb with the rub and let it sit, covered, at room temperature for 2 hours or marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
			<p class="rp">If the lamb has been marinated overnight, remove it from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to bring it to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" role="doc-pagebreak" title="141"/>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the oil into a cast-iron skillet or heavy pan and warm over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, sear the lamb, browning each side for about 3 minutes or until a deep golden char is achieved. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 1 to 1½ hours or until the meat softens and easily pulls away from the bone.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once cool enough to touch, pull the meat from the bone, coarsely chop it into bite-size pieces, and shred the pieces into strands. Reincorporate the juices and rendered fat into the pulled chopped meat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Just before serving, reheat the cast-iron skillet and crisp the lamb, pressing the strands with a spatula, browning the bottoms and then flipping the meat to do the same on the other side. You should have a varied texture with a mix of crispy and soft pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, scoop the hummus onto a plate or into a shallow bowl. Use the back of a spoon to form a moat between the outer edge and the center. Spoon the hot crispy lamb, along with its juices, into the well and garnish with a bit more oil and spice mix.</p>
			<p class="rp">The lamb can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS IS A</span> bright, creamy, pomegranate-eggplant salad, but hold the tahini, please. It’s a mystery why baba ghanouj, one of our most widely known dishes, is so different in the United States from that in the Arab world. When we talk about baba ghanouj in the Levant, we are referring to a tart salad of creamy roasted eggplant, brightened with pomegranate molasses and flecked with tomatoes—which is what this is!</p>
			<p class="rhn">If you’re looking for an eggplant spread made with garlic and tahini, you’ll find recipes under mutabal (see beginning on <a href="c05.xhtml#page_146">this page</a>). Eat this baba ghanouj with bread, or it’s also delicious as a side salad.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 large globe eggplants (about 2 pounds)</p>
			<p class="ril">Olive oil, for rubbing eggplants, plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves, minced</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 2 lemons</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">1 small Roma tomato, finely diced</p>
			<p class="ril">½ red bell pepper, finely diced</p>
			<p class="ril">½ red onion, finely diced</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="rpf">Cook the eggplants directly on the burner of a gas stove or in the oven. On a gas stove, sear the eggplants directly over a medium-high flame. Rotate every 5 minutes until the globes are completely blackened, about 15 minutes total. Alternately, preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the eggplants on a sheet tray, poke them all over with the tines of a fork, rub them with the oil, and place the tray in the oven and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until the eggplants collapse in on themselves, and the skins are blackened.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the cooked eggplants in a bowl and seal the bowl with plastic wrap to let the eggplants steam in their own juices.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, lemon juice and zest, cumin, salt, and black pepper.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the eggplants have cooled enough to touch, split them lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out the pulp, discarding the skins and stems. For a milder flavor, scrape the seeds off the strands of pulp.</p>
			<p class="rp">Use a fork to mash the pulp into the lemon-garlic mix. Fold in the tomato, bell pepper, and onion. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, scoop the eggplant mixture onto a serving plate, drizzle it with the olive oil, and garnish it with the parsley and molasses.

			<p class="ry">Makes scant 3 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I REMEMBER THE</span> first time I served this spread at an event. Several people reacted the same way: “It’s like an Arab romesco sauce!” I wonder if the Catalonians intersected with Arabs during the time when they conquered Spain to inspire this tomato, almond, and pepper sauce, but in the end, it doesn’t matter. All great things travel, and muhammara is a great thing.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The Arabic word <span class="i">muhammara</span> translates literally to “something that is red,” so the trick to this dish is to choose peppers with the deepest ripe-red hue possible to create the perfect sweet pepper spread. The secret ingredient is a backdrop of sweet and tart pomegranate molasses to brighten all the other flavors. Snack on this with fresh flatbread or toss it into your pasta. There is no wrong way to eat muhammara.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 large red bell peppers (about 1½ pounds) or one 15-ounce can roasted red peppers, drained and rinsed</p>

			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">If you are using fresh bell peppers, place them on the prepared tray. Roast the peppers until the skins are charred, about 30 minutes, turning them over once or twice. Transfer to a resealable bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap and set aside. Once cool, tear the peppers open and remove the stems, seeds, and skins.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine the walnuts and bread crumbs in a food processor and process to a cornmeal-like texture. Add the roasted peppers, garlic, molasses, lemon juice, Aleppo pepper, salt, and cumin. Pulse until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</p>
			<p class="rp">With the processor running, slowly add the oil and blend until the oil is completely incorporated. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, scoop the pepper mixture, chilled or at room temperature, onto a serving plate. With the back of a spoon, create little divots for the oil to fall into. Drizzle with the oil and garnish with the chopped walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and parsley.</p>
			<p class="rp">The spread can be stored, ungarnished, in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE TAHINI-LACED EGGPLANT</span> version of this dish is ubiquitous in Arab restaurants and homes across the United States. Growing up, we called it baba ghanouj, but I later learned that in the Arab world, baba ghanouj means a more citrusy eggplant salad. There, this dish of mashed vegetables with creamy tahini is more commonly called mutabal, which means a dish that’s made tastier or more flavorful with spices. When people refer to mutabal, the default vegetable is eggplant, but it actually can be made with just about any vegetable, as I share in the following two recipes.</p>
			<p class="rhn">With each variation, the preparation of the vegetable distinguishes the dish. In the case of eggplant, roasting makes it tastier, and I char mine for a smoky flavor. Most versions I taste today are too watered down and too garlicky—the smokiness of the cumin and charred eggplant in this version achieves the complexity I prefer.</p>

			<p class="rhn">This spread starts off sweet, then gets a little spicy, and ends with an earthy, savory flavor that will make you want to go back for more. Like most of the spreads in this chapter, it tastes even better when made a day ahead, giving all of the flavors a chance to meld. This makes a lovely dip for bread, carrots, radishes, and cucumbers.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 red beets (about 2 pounds)</p>

Add the garlic, chile, lemon juice, cumin, and the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and blend for about 5 minutes, until creamy and smooth.

This spread of sweet pomegranate-roasted butternut squash balances with the acidity of fresh lemon and a little bite from the garlic and pepper and works equally well with acorn, pumpkin, and other winter squash. It’s beautiful served on its own, scooped with Khobz Arabi (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_71">this page</a>), or used as a complement to the other mutabal spreads in this chapter. The squash can be roasted ahead for quick assembly; once roasted, the dish comes together in fewer than 5 minutes.</p>

			<p class="rt">Chard-Tahini Spread</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 2 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">CREAMY, NUTTY TAHINI</span> plays beautifully off of Swiss chard’s deeply vegetal minerality, mixed with a one-two punch of garlic and lemon for a spread that’s as tasty as it is nutritious. This is the kind of dish I’ve seen in Lebanon, where seasonal produce gets integrated into menus, but never in the United States.</p>
			<p class="rhn">To showcase the seasonality in Arab cuisine, I first introduced this dish at the Culinary Institute of America during their Worlds of Flavors event as part of a rainbow trio with red beet and golden butternut squash mutabal. I spent anxiety-filled hours convincing myself my dishes were more than “just dips.” But tasting each one side by side, I realized that I was providing a dish that was not only visually stunning but also one with the perfect balance of earthy, sweet, and acidic flavor. This recipe is an exceptionally flavorful play on this hearty green. And, really, who couldn’t use an excuse for a few more greens in their diet?</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 bunches green Swiss chard</p>
			<p class="ril">4 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons), plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon lemon zest</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon sumac (optional) for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper (optional) for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Remove the tough ends of the chard stalks and reserve for another use. (It’s okay for some stems to remain.) Rinse the chard and blanch it in boiling water for about 2 minutes or until tender. The leaves should pluck easily from the stalks but still hold together. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze well with your hands to remove excess water.</p>
			<p class="rp">Chop the chard and add it to a food processor along with the garlic, lemon juice and zest, salt, and oil to make a smooth paste. Blend at medium speed until the leaves form small pesto-like flecks. Drizzle in the tahini and pulse until it’s a uniform pale green color. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Adjust the salt and lemon juice to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, scoop the chard mixture onto a serving plate, drizzle it with the oil, and garnish with the sumac and Aleppo pepper.</p>
			<p class="rp">This dip can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days before it loses its vibrant color.</p>

			<p class="rt">Fava Mash with Roasted Garlic</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 6 to 8 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">FUL MADAMMAS WAS</span> my mother’s go-to weekend breakfast. A creamy, mild fava stew, cooked low and slow, this stew reduces to a simple and hearty canvas for an infinite array of fresh toppings. Dried unpeeled or canned favas work equally well. Arab grocers stock many varieties of favas, and, using canned, which my mother opted for, will get you from the stove to the table in a matter of minutes if your garlic is roasted ahead.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Favas are among the oldest-known cultivated plants, so it’s no wonder that ful is a staple across the Arab world and likely traces its roots to ancient Egypt. Recipes vary from house to house and region to region. I’ve lightened the fava beans with a mix of chickpeas, the way most Palestinians do, and given it heady notes of caramelized onion and roasted garlic.</p>
			<p class="rhn">For an extra kick, top it with Tatbeeleh (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_42">this page</a>), a lemon-chile relish, and a mix of any fresh herbs you have on hand; to add a Gazan flair, sprinkle on some freshly chopped chiles and dill at the end. If you want to route toward Jerusalem, turn it into the classic dish Qudsiyah by spooning ful on top of a fresh plate of Hummus (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_138">this page</a>). It’s eaten, of course, with warm Khobz Arabi (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_71">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rhn">This dish makes a perfect centerpiece in a breakfast mezze, spread with crudités, sliced cheeses, boiled eggs, and olives.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ cups small dried fava beans or one 28-ounce can fava beans with its liquid</p>
			<p class="ril">⅛ teaspoon baking soda (for dried fava beans only)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heads garlic</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for roasting the garlic and for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for roasting the garlic and as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 small yellow onion, finely diced</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cumin, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">One 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ pint cherry tomatoes, halved</p>
			<p class="ril">4 sprigs of parsley, stems removed and coarsely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">½ bunch scallions, ends trimmed and finely chopped</p>
			<p class="rpf">If you are using dried beans, immerse them in hot water and the baking soda and soak them overnight at room temperature. Drain thoroughly and then rinse the beans.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the favas in a small pot and add water until waterline is 2 inches above the beans. Simmer until soft, about 45 minutes. Reserve 1½ cups of the cooking liquid. If you are using canned beans, skip this step.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat your toaster oven or home oven to 400°F to roast your garlic.</p>
			<p class="rp">Slice the stem ends of the garlic heads about a ¼ inch down, revealing the tops of the cloves. Set the heads on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to fully enclose them. Drizzle the heads with about a tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and tightly close the foil.</p>
			<p class="rp">Roast for about 1½ hours or until the heads smell fragrant and toasty and the insides are golden brown and tender. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, unwrap and simply squeeze the heads from the bottom to release the roasted cloves. Discard the heads and set the roasted cloves aside for garnish.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium saucepan, warm 3 tablespoons oil and sauté the onion over medium heat, until lightly caramelized. Add the chopped garlic cloves, ¼ teaspoon salt, and cumin and sauté until they smell aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fava beans with their reserved liquid (just enough to cover the beans), then simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender and smashable, about 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" role="doc-pagebreak" title="152"/>Turn off the heat and, with a potato masher or the back of a spoon, smash the beans until only half or less of the whole beans remain. If the stew dries out, add some water until you get the texture you want. I like a cross between mashed and whole beans. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the chickpeas, and simmer until warmed. Adjust the salt and cumin to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice and roasted garlic. To serve, spread in a serving bowl, drizzle with the oil, and top with the tomatoes, parsley, and scallions.</p>
			<p class="rp">This dish can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature or made ahead and stored, ungarnished, in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 14 stuffed falafel balls</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">WHEN I SET</span> out to create my restaurants, I swore I’d never serve falafel. I even included that pledge in an early version of my tagline: “Beyond the falafel and shawarma.” I wanted to prove Arab cuisine’s rich complexity and bust out of the confines to which we’d been reduced. But people asked for falafel so often that we could no longer ignore the demand. I gave in, and Reem’s began to serve what would become one of our best sellers.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I came across this chile and onion stuffing, a Jerusalem specialty, while researching my perfect falafel. Arabs like to stuff just about everything, even falafel. These crispy balls deliver a silky caramelized onion surprise and a burst of spice with every crunch. Do not use canned beans, since they are already cooked; the crunch that makes falafel irresistible comes from frying rehydrated uncooked beans.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Falafel are best eaten fresh from the fryer. They’re delicious dipped into Taratoor (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_39">this page</a>), a lemon-tahini sauce, rolled into a delicious round of Khobz Saj (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_73">this page</a>), a griddle-cooked flatbread, and served with any of the pickles in this book.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Feel free to get creative with the filling. At Reem’s we sometimes fill ours with a soft-boiled egg and call it a fleg.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • This falafel is easily scaled up so that you can make enough to cover your falafel needs for multiple meals. Pack any extra mix in gallon-size resealable bags and press to flatten; keep frozen until ready to use. To use, thaw the bag at room temperature or submerge in warm water, then proceed with stuffing and frying.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1¼ cups dried chickpeas</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups coarsely chopped yellow onions (about 1 onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ tablespoons coarsely chopped garlic (about 3 cloves)</p>

			<p class="ril">2 cups finely diced red onions (about 1 large onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon sumac, plus more as needed</p>

			<p class="rpf">Immerse the chickpeas in water several inches above the beans and soak for 3 to 4 hours or overnight.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a food processor, combine the yellow onions, garlic, chile, parsley, and cilantro and pulse until you get a uniform green paste.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak" title="155"/>Drain the beans, discarding the water, and gradually add them to the food processor, pulsing until the mixture is uniformly pale green and flecked with tiny specks of chickpeas. The texture is a matter of preference; I like mine the texture of fine bulgur. Proceed with care when blending; overblending can cause the herbs to oxidize and release water.</p>
			<p class="rp">Test the bean mixture by forming a ball in your hands. The mixture should be moist enough to hold together but not so soft that it is difficult to shape. The liquid shouldn’t be visible, but when you squeeze the mixture, water should leach out.</p>
			<p class="rp">Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and work the salt, coriander, cumin, ginger, cardamom, and baking powder into the mixture with your hands until well incorporated. Set the falafel mixture in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or the freezer for 10 minutes to chill.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the falafel mixture is chilling, sauté the red onions in the oil over medium-low heat, until they become soft and slightly caramelized. Add the sumac, hot sauce, and salt and adjust to taste. Let the filling cool before using.</p>
			<p class="rp">Use a falafel mold, ice cream scoop, or your hands to form fourteen balls (about 2 ounces each). Lay the balls on a sheet tray and chill in the freezer for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the falafel mixture is chilled, press each ball into a 3-inch patty in the palm of your hand. Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle and cup your palm to enclose the filling. Smooth the seam with your other hand and then gently roll the ball between both hands to form a uniform ball.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the falafel balls on a sheet tray and let the pan rest in the freezer for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Line a sheet tray or plate with paper towels and place a cooling rack on top.</p>
			<p class="rp">Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep pot over high heat until a probe or instant-read thermometer reads about 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Put the sesame seeds in a small bowl. Roll the balls in the seeds and, using a slotted spoon, gently lower them into the oil. Fry in batches of three to five, allowing room for them to bounce around. Coat the next set of balls as each batch fries. When the falafel float to the surface, flip them to ensure all sides cook evenly. Each batch should fry for 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">With the slotted spoon, transfer the stuffed falafel to the prepared rack. Repeat the process until all the balls have been fried.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve with the hot sauce and flatbread.</p>

			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings on a mezze table or as a side</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">BATATA HARRA, WHICH</span> translates to “spicy potatoes,” goes on any large mezze spread. It’s perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I made it my mission in this recipe to maximize the crispy outer edges while keeping the inside light and airy. The secret is to poach the potatoes in salted water before frying; this allows them to release some of their starch, keeping them moist and fluffy in the center. A solid smash before frying breaks the skin to create crispier edges.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Potatoes</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ pounds fingerling or Yukon gold potatoes</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rilh">Aioli</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons Spicy Red Pepper Paste (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_38">this page</a>) or store-bought harissa paste</p>
			<p class="ril">2 egg yolks</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon honey, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon ice water</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 cups neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola, for frying</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons minced garlic (about 3 cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>), plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="rpf">Add the potatoes to a pot with enough water to cover by about 2 inches. Season with the coriander and salt. Bring to a low simmer and cook until tender; a knife should pierce with little to no resistance, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Drain the potatoes and allow to cool slightly.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the aioli: While the potatoes are cooking, combine the red pepper paste, egg yolks, garlic, lemon juice, honey, and salt in a blender or food processor and blend until well incorporated. Then slowly drizzle in half of the olive oil and continue blending, until the sauce is thickened. Add the ice water to help stabilize the sauce and keep it from breaking. Drizzle in the remaining oil until thickened a bit more. The sauce should resemble a loose, runny mayonnaise. Adjust the salt to taste. If using store-bought harissa, it can have some bitterness; balance the flavor by adding more honey if needed. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the potatoes are cool enough to touch, use your palm or the bottom of a bowl or coffee mug to smash the potatoes, just enough to break the skin and expose the insides. Give larger smashed potatoes a rough chop into bite-size pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, heat the neutral oil until a probe or instant-read thermometer reads about 375°F. Fry the potato pieces until crispy and golden brown, about 2 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To finish: Immediately transfer the potatoes to a bowl, toss in the garlic, cilantro, Aleppo pepper, salt, and olive oil until evenly coated. Drizzle the aioli over the potatoes or serve alongside as a dipping sauce.</p>

			<p class="rt">Smoked Fish, Caramelized Onions, and Tahini Spread</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 1 cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS DELICACY, FLAKY</span> white fish in creamy tahini with caramelized onions, is dedicated to my ride-or-die work wife, Zaynah, who helped me build Reem’s from the ground up. Like me, one of her parents is a Palestinian-Beiruti transplant. Though it’s mostly unspoken, we both claim our identities through food.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Her knowledge of Arab cuisine is so expansive that when customers hear her speak about our menu, they often ask if she, herself, is Reem. I laugh when I hear this, hoping she’ll say “Yes”; to me, we could be interchangeable (if I were just a little more comfortable in public). Zaynah’s comforting spirit embodies Reem’s as a place to experience the warmth of Arab hospitality. She spent time living in Beirut and often reminisces about the food there. Having never lived there myself, I relish her stories, and whenever I have the next “big idea” for a menu item, no matter how silly, we experiment together until it’s perfect.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Tajine Lubnani appears on many of the mezze spreads Zaynah sampled in Lebanon. Traditionally, the dish is made with baked fish, but it reminded me of the smoked mackerel salads I have tasted in Jewish delis, and that inspired us to substitute cured fish.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Cured fish is available at most local and chain grocery stores. I prefer mackerel or mullet, fattier fishes that absorb more smoke flavor. Cured fish varies in salinity, so taste the mix before adding salt to see if it needs any at all.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 large onion, thinly sliced</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup water</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">8 ounces smoked white fish, deboned and broken into small chunks (about ½ cup of flaked fish)</p>
			<p class="ril">Kosher salt (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon zest</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons chopped chives (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup pine nuts or slivered almonds, toasted</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium pan over medium heat, add the onion slices and caramelize until they are soft and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring frequently toward the end so they don’t burn. Set the pan aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the onions are caramelizing, in a medium bowl, combine the water and tahini and whisk until no lumps remain. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until the mixture starts to thicken, then add the cumin. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the onions have cooled, fold them and the fish into the tahini mixture, creating a nice thick dip. Add salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, spread the dip in a shallow bowl and press with the back of a spoon to form small wells. Drizzle with the oil and top with lemon zest, chives, and pine nuts.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">ONE OF MY</span> favorite memories from visits to Beirut was listening to the sizzle of fried pine nuts in hot clarified butter hit the top of a fatteh at street corner stalls, where vendors were making this dish to order for hungry crowds.</p>
			<p class="rhn">It takes only one bite to understand the magic of fatteh, the ultimate breakfast and brunch mezze dish and a perfect cure for a hangover. Fattet simply means “a fatteh composed of…[fill in the blank].” That could include a layered dish of chickpeas and any other ingredients your heart desires, spooned atop a bed of crispy pita chips and blanketed by a rich yogurt-tahini sauce, then rounded out with herbs, toasted nuts, and the delicious tart notes of pomegranate. I’ve opted here for the addition of an aromatic short rib braise. Left to sit for a while, the fried bread soaks in the rich broth and yogurt to resemble a savory bread pudding.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is also great for potlucks and can be doubled to create a larger casserole to share with friends or neighbors. It can be covered in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week and reheats nicely in the oven, right in the same baking dish.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ pounds bone-in beef short ribs</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, or one 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">Pinch of baking soda (for dried chickpeas only)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">1 yellow onion, cut into large wedges</p>
			<p class="ril">½ fennel bulb, cut into large wedges</p>
			<p class="ril">3 garlic cloves, halved</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">5 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cumin</p>
			<p class="rilh">Sauce</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup whole milk yogurt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon tahini</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon minced or grated garlic (about 1 clove)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 cups store-bought pita chips or 2-inch pieces of pita bread, fried</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup pine nuts</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses, and/or ¼ cup pomegranate seeds</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a large bowl, rub the short ribs with the salt, spice mix, Aleppo pepper, and cardamom, then cover and refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours ahead of time. Set the ribs out at room temperature 90 minutes before cooking.</p>
			<p class="rp">If you are using dried chickpeas, place them in a small pot with a pinch of baking soda and cover the beans with about 6 inches of water. Bring to a boil, skim, discard the residue from the water’s surface, and decrease the heat to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, uncovered, until the beans soften, about 30 minutes. Test for doneness by squeezing a bean between your thumb and forefinger. If you are using canned chickpeas, skip this step.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Warm the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the short ribs, cooking to a nice crusty brown before flipping, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, char the onion, fennel bulb, and garlic on medium-high heat. Return the meat to the Dutch oven and add about 3 cups hot water or just enough to barely cover the ribs. Add the fennel seeds, cardamom pods, and bay leaf. Cover and braise until the meat easily pulls away from the bone, 2½ to 3 hours. If you do not have a Dutch oven, sear the meat and vegetables in a cast-iron or heavy skillet and transfer to a roasting pan, add water and spices, and cover with aluminum foil before cooking. Set the meat aside and allow to cool slightly if time permits.</p>
			<p class="rp">Strain the braising liquid into a small saucepan. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160" role="doc-pagebreak" title="160"/>Discard the remaining braising vegetables and bones. Bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat and then decrease the heat to a simmer. Add the cumin and chickpeas and simmer until the chickpeas are tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Tear the meat to your liking, into shreds or small chunks.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the sauce: Combine the yogurt, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until incorporated.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to assemble, spread the pita chips in a base layer of a serving bowl or a casserole dish. Spoon the warm shredded meat over the top, then ladle the broth and chickpeas over the meat and chips. Next, drizzle on an even layer of the yogurt sauce.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, sauté the pine nuts in the butter over medium-low heat, stirring continuously until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drizzle the sizzling butter and pine nuts over the dish. Top with the parsley and molasses.</p>

			<p class="rt">Ground Meat and Bulgur Patties Stuffed with Herbed Ghee</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 24 patties</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">KIBBEH IS CONSIDERED</span> the national dish of Syria. Aleppo alone has more than seventeen varieties. They are fried, grilled, and baked in an array of shapes and sizes. Some are filled by the piece, while others are pressed into large trays. We grew up receiving care packages from an aunt in Chicago, who shipped frozen ones to us overnight. She was the kibbeh master. Anytime we wanted, we could just pop them in the toaster oven.</p>
			<p class="rp">This recipe is based on a variety I ate while visiting northern Syria with my youngest sister, Manal. Qraas, which translates to “disk” in Arabic, is used to describe this kibbeh. They look like small flying saucers and are traditionally grilled on an outdoor fire rather than fried or baked. We had never seen kibbeh shaped or cooked like that, and there was a surprisingly luxurious taste inside each disk that we only realized was tallow after eating one too many. I wanted to re-create that luxurious taste but make it a little lighter.</p>
			<p class="rp">The filling can be made with any solid animal fat. If you’re using butter, be sure to take the extra step of clarifying it (see <a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) to remove the moisture and milk solids.</p>
			<p class="rp">You can make these patties and freeze them in resealable bags for up to 6 months. They’re great to pull out for mezze spreads and late-night snacks.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup bulgur #1 (fine size)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound lean ground beef or lamb (or a mixture of both)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups diced yellow onions (about 1 onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>) or ground allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">⅔ cup Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>), softened</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup chopped mint leaves (about ½ bunch)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups finely diced red onions (about 1 small onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>); optional</p>
			<p class="rils">Olive oil for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the dough: Line a tray or a plate with paper towels.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small bowl, cover the bulgur with boiling water and allow to soak for 1 hour. After soaking, press the bulgur with your hands or with the back of a spoon and squeeze out the last remaining moisture. Make sure the bulgur is completely cool before mixing with the beef.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine the meat, onions, spice mix, salt, black pepper, and cinnamon and mix on high speed in a food processor, about 2 minutes, until the meat resembles a sticky dough; don’t overmix or the meat will become grainy.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the hydrated bulgur and pulse just until the bulgur disappears. Knead the mixture in a bowl until it is uniform and homogenous and resembles a slightly sticky dough. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the meat and set the bowl in the refrigerator to chill.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: Combine the butter, mint, red onions, salt, and Aleppo pepper in a food processor and blend until it forms a smooth paste. (If you don’t have a food processor, chop everything very finely and paddle with a spoon.)</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the patties: Prepare an ice water bath to chill your fingers and prevent the dough from sticking to your hands. Divide the dough into 24 pieces, about the size of golf balls (about 38 grams each). You may have a bit of dough left over; this is great to use for patching any holes if needed.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place one ball of the meat dough in the palm of your hand and pat it into an even 3-inch disk.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place a heaping teaspoon (about 11 grams) of the filling in the center of the disk. Cup the dough in your hand around the filling to create a sphere. Gently pinch and smooth the seam to seal. Pat gently into a 2-inch disk, making sure to smooth the sides so the filling doesn’t burst out when cooking. Set aside and repeat until all of the dough balls have been filled and sealed.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" role="doc-pagebreak" title="163"/>Heat a cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Brush the pan with the oil and lay down four or five kibbeh at a time, depending on the size of your pan. Decrease the heat to medium-low and cook the patties for about 5 minutes, until they are crispy and brown; then turn over and cook for another 5 minutes, until they are cooked through and the stuffing has melted. Repeat the process until you cook all of your patties.</p>
			<p class="rp">Alternatively, preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake the patties on a sheet tray for 25 to 30 minutes or until crisped and brown. Crisp under the broiler for a minute or two if needed. Serve hot on a mezze spread or as a finger food for a party.</p>
