			<p class="fmpf"><span class="upper">SHUKRAN! THANK YOU!</span></p>
			<p class="p">Words alone cannot capture my thanks. For that, I would need food. And justice. And love. To all the people who have stood by me, held space for me, and experienced joy with me, you have my infinite gratitude.</p>
			<p class="p">My mama, Iman, equally powerful against adversaries and generous beyond measure. You are my rock.</p>
			<p class="p">My baba, Naim, your knack for knowing when I need to be connected to my roots has fed me time and again.</p>
			<p class="p">My sisters, Dalyah and Manal, who fill my life with pleasure. You are the orange blossom syrup to my knafeh.</p>
			<p class="p">My aunts and uncles, near and far, your meals and laughter lift and inspire me.</p>
			<p class="p">My partner, J, whose motto, “Don’t stop, don’t quit,” has pulled me through hard times. Your grace and ease safeguard me. Our beautiful son, Zain. Who knew the human heart could love like this? In the words of poet Ellen Bass, I’ve become one of the “…mothers, with their hearts beating outside their bodies.”</p>
			<p class="p">My grandparents, Nabigha and Tahsin, you demonstrated that the meals we eat together can feed our souls along with our bodies.</p>
			<p class="p">My Uncle Eyad, whose homemade focaccia was the first, and best, I’ve ever tasted. Asker-of-hard questions, you helped crack open my defenses under the refuge of California’s redwoods.</p>
			<p class="p">The Reem’s team, past and present, I have learned from every one of you. Hai, my fairy godmother, your administrative wizardry made space for the important things. Zaynah, my ride-or-die, who brings Reem’s to life with me. You embody the truest spirit of Arab hospitality.</p>
			<p class="p">La Cocina staff and entrepreneurs. Caleb Zigas, you went out of your way to drum up support each time I reached the brink, and Emiliana Puyana and Blake Kutner, you taught me how to cook bold and refined dishes that defied my insecurities.</p>
			<p class="p">My guardian angel Ghassan Haddad, you drove your masonry and tools up from Southern California to build me the hearth from which a thousand loaves would rise.</p>
			<p class="p">All the entrepreneurship programs (there were a lot): ICA Fund Good Jobs, Food Systems 6, Centro Community Partners, Women’s Initiative, you each had a hand in nurturing my inner entrepreneur.</p>
			<p class="p">My unofficial uncle Jess Ghannam, who provided support in just the way I needed it and doubled down when the going got tough. You believed in me even when my own belief faltered.</p>
			<p class="p">The fierce activists who continue to tell the truth about the Palestinian struggle. I am blessed to walk in your footsteps.</p>
			<p class="p">Rasmea Odeh, you remind me to find joy in the struggle, even when I’m afraid.</p>
			<p class="p">My organizing community, past and present, you encourage me to take a chance on food.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_289" role="doc-pagebreak" title="289"/>Arab Resource and Organizing Center—Lara Kiswani, Sami Kitmitto, Chris Lymbertos, Sharif Zakout, and the crew—you continue to be my political home. Center for Third World Organizing, East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy, School for Unity and Liberation, Residents United for a Livable Emeryville, and SEIU, your trainings in ground-up organizing are part of everything I do.</p>
			<p class="p">My allies—Jewish Voices for Piece, International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Critical Resistance, ANSWER, Third World for Black Power—always ready with a flatbed truck and microphone to amplify our voices. Thank you for having my back against my harassers and fighting for a more liberatory abolitionist future.</p>
			<p class="p">Left Wing Fútbol Club, you build community while fighting imperialism. A special shout-out to mama Sita Kuratomi Bhaumik, you schemed menus with me for team dinners while we peeled thousands of chickpeas for my first pop-ups.</p>
			<p class="p">Alicia Garza, you summoned your own food origins in the foreword and inspire me to live my best life even in the hard work of transformation.</p>
			<p class="p">Palestinian women cookbook writers Laila El-Haddad, Joudie Kalla, Reem Kassis, and Rawia Bishara, you paved the way for our voices to be heard.</p>
			<p class="p">Bay Area chef community, you accepted me as one of your own, despite my unconventional path to food, and opened opportunities of which I could only have dreamed.</p>
			<p class="p">IMEU and Life and Thyme crew, you helped tell stories that I didn’t even know I had. And all the food media writers and producers, you made space for my voice in the face of death threats and raging opposition.</p>
			<p class="p">My high school history teacher Bill Schechter, you taught me that we live our history and first helped me find the words to capture it.</p>
			<p class="p">All the kick-ass women who helped bring this book to life:</p>
			<p class="p">Michelle Minori, chef extraordinaire, you tested every recipe and added you own special flair to deepen flavors. I am thankful for your mentorship.</p>
			<p class="p">Alana Hale, Jillian Knox, and Fanny Pan, you rocked the photoshoots and brought laughter and dance into the mix. Cece Carpio, you captured the essence of my story in your beautiful illustrations.</p>
			<p class="p">My agent, Rica Allanic, you followed my work from across the country and kept after me until I finally agreed to write this book.</p>
			<p class="p">My editor Kelly Snowden and art director Betsy Stromberg, along with the rest of the Ten Speed Press crew. Your enthusiasm and eye for beauty provided the cracks that let the light in during the darkness of a pandemic.</p>
			<p class="p">Emily Timberlake, you came to my side when I was figuring out what this book would be and offered wit and wisdom as an editor and lover of food and justice.</p>
			<p class="p">And finally, my Aunt Emily. Yours was another kitchen that I grew up in. Thank you for excavating family stories with me, distilling meaning and rhyme from the way the world has shaped me. Thank you for believing in this project and taking a chance to help me bring it to life, with your heart wide open.</p>
