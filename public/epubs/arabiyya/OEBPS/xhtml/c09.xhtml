			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">ASHTA IS THE</span> King Midas of Arab desserts: everything it touches turns to gold. Whether layered onto Layali Lubnan (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_259">this page</a>), a farina custard, or served on its own with a touch of honey and sprinkled with pistachio bits, it delivers a rich, mouthy goodness.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In Lebanon, entire factories are lined with giant shallow stainless-steel pans boiling fresh local milk over low heat to harvest the sticky film of protein that forms on top. In everyday life, however, it is not practical to wait for skin to develop and slowly skim it off layer by layer. I’ve sped up that process by using lemon and vinegar to force the fat to separate from the whey through curdling.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe comes together in two steps: (1) collecting and reserving clots of cream formed by curdling a portion of the cream or milk with lemon; and (2) thickening the remaining cream with starch. The two parts are then whisked back together.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • This recipe works using all milk if you don’t have cream on hand, but I like the extra richness of the cream. Avoid using reduced-fat milk, since it will not curdle properly.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons rose water</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon), plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups heavy cream</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons cornstarch</p>
			<p class="rpf">Line a colander or sieve with cheesecloth and set over a bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk until just before a boil. Stir the bottom of the pot occasionally to make sure the milk isn’t scalding. Just before the milk boils, stir in 1 tablespoon of the sugar, the rose and orange blossom waters, lemon juice, and vinegar. The milk should immediately begin forming clots. Turn down the heat to the lowest setting.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a slotted spoon, collect the clots of milk from the surface and place them into the prepared colander. Continue collecting the clots, until the milk that remains looks thin and pale and takes on a yellowish hue. If needed, add a few more teaspoons of lemon juice to induce further clotting.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour out and discard the whey (you could save this for another purpose, such as using it in a smoothie, but that’s up to you). Remove the pot from the heat and add the cream, cornstarch, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, then return the pot to the stove and bring to a boil on medium heat, whisking until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Allow to cool slightly, then add the strained clotted cream and whisk well, until it forms a thickened spread. If it’s still clumpy, pass the clotted cream through a fine-mesh sieve. Put into a bowl and cover directly with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming. Chill for at least 1 hour before using.</p>
			<p class="rp">If not using right away, the clotted cream can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="rt">Spiced Rice Flour Pudding</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IN THE ARAB</span> world, each special occasion merits its own distinct sweet. Meghli, a smooth, cool, spice-steeped rice flour pudding, is made to celebrate the birth of a child in many Arab homes. It is believed that caraway helps increase milk for new moms, but that doesn’t stop everyone else from savoring this mildly sweet, refreshing dessert. Elegant when served in chilled parfait glasses, it’s also a festive dessert for Christmas, celebrating one of the world’s most famous births.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Growing up, we must have had many births around us! It seemed my mother was always whisking and chilling meghli into delicate glasses that the Lebanese called demis, short for demitasse or half cups, and sprinkling them with blanched almonds and coconut.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I learned to love meghli served cold, as it is done in Lebanon. In Syria, it is called karawyah and served as a delicious warm winter pudding. A wheat version called snayniyeh is often made to celebrate a child’s first tooth. This gluten-free, vegan version is sure to meet everyone’s needs. If you don’t have nut milk or oat milk, you can make it the traditional way with water.</p>
			<p class="rilf"><span class="frac">½</span> cup rice flour</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons ground caraway</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons ground anise</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">4 cups almond or oat milk</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup shredded unsweetened coconut</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup ground pistachios</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup toasted sliced almonds</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, caraway, anise, and cinnamon.</p>
			<p class="rp">Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over low heat. When the liquid just begins to simmer, gradually whisk in the flour mixture. Continue to cook over medium-low heat, whisking for 5 to 7 minutes or until the milk thickens. Test for doneness by running your finger down the back of a coated spoon. When it leaves a clear streak, remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture into six small serving dishes (6- to 8-ounce ramekins work well) to cool. Once the meghli reaches room temperature, refrigerate, uncovered, to chill for at least 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, sprinkle each cup with layers of coconut, pistachios, and sliced almonds. The meghli can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MAHALABIYA IS THE</span> custardy cousin or, I would argue, maybe the original Italian dessert panna cotta. In my search for a simple but elegant dessert, I became obsessed with learning about this delicacy. It has roots in seventh-century Persia and was introduced to Arabs in tenth-century Baghdad, but it must have influenced custards beyond the region. Mahalabiya is not much different from blancmange in Europe and maja blanca in the Philippines.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Mahalabiya is the ideal canvas for showcasing seasonal fruit. When it’s apricot season, I incorporate a thin layer of M’rabaa Mish Mish (<a href="c08.xhtml#page_243">this page</a>) on top. When it’s summer, this chilled dessert gets a crown of berries, as it does in this recipe. Strawberries in this recipe can be swapped for 8 ounces of any seasonal fruit, so feel free to be creative!</p>
			<p class="rhn">This custard firms up beautifully in small glasses or ramekins. The trick to perfecting this fragrant treat is to frequently whisk the custard as it cooks, so as not to scald the milk.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Custard</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon gently cracked cardamom pods (about 18 pods)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup cornstarch</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup cold heavy cream</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons rose water</p>
			<p class="rilh">Topping</p>
			<p class="ril">8 ounces strawberries, hulled and quartered or sliced</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon rose water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon sugar, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_257" role="doc-pagebreak" title="257"/>lemon)</p>
			<p class="rilf">¼ cup crushed pistachios, toasted</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons dried rose petals (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the custard: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the milk, sugar, and cardamom pods and bring to a slow simmer. When bubbles start to form, turn down the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes to steep the cardamom pods.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium bowl, whisk the cornstarch into the cream until fully incorporated. Slowly whisk the cornstarch mixture into the hot milk, until it’s thickened. When the mixture holds the imprint of the whisk’s loops, remove it from the heat after about 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the rose water and then pour the warm mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Transfer into four 6-ounce serving glasses or ramekins. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 4 to 6 hours to firm and chill.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the topping: In a medium saucepan, combine the strawberries, rose water, sugar, and ground cardamom and bring to a boil over high heat. Then turn down to low, cover the pan, and simmer for about 10 minutes to release the fruit’s juices. Uncover the pan and simmer until the liquid thickens and the strawberries soften, intensify in color, and start to shrink, another 10 to 15 minutes. Add the lemon juice. Adjust the sugar to taste. Let cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">Just before serving, spoon the compote onto each chilled custard and sprinkle with the pistachios and rose petals.</p>
			<p class="rp">The custard can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">LAYALI LUBNAN TRANSLATES</span> to “Lebanese nights,” but no one seems to know quite why. I believe, as many do, that the dessert’s layers celebrate the colors of the Lebanese flag: white pudding, green pistachios, and red rose petals or pomegranate seeds.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Like all trifles, this one delivers an elegance that belies its easy assembly. If the ingredients are already in your pantry, it’s easy to whip up on a moment’s notice, as my mother did on many occasions. She always kept a tub of Cool Whip in the freezer just for this dish. I’ve upgraded, layering in clotted cream on the lower deck to create a decadent but light melt-in-your-mouth custard.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is portioned for a dinner party—made in a clear dish 9 by 13-inch—but it can be easily halved and served in goblet-shaped glasses or in a clear 8 by 8-inch dish.</p>
			<p class="rilf">½ cup sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">7 cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">1¼ cups farina or Cream of Wheat</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon rose water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

			<p class="ril">½ cup ground pistachios</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup pomegranate seeds (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat. When the milk starts to bubble, sprinkle in the farina, whisking vigorously. Turn down the heat to low and switch to a spatula or wooden spoon so you can scrape the bottom of the pot. Use caution when stirring, since the cereal may bubble aggressively. Add the salt, orange blossom and rose waters, and vanilla. Continue to whisk until the custard is thick enough to make whisking tiring, about 5 minutes; it should look like thick mashed potatoes. When scraping the bottom of the pot, you should be able to see the bottom of the pot for just half a second before the cereal covers the bottom again. Turn off the heat and pour the custard into a 9 by 13-inch pan or other clear-sided serving dish. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 1 hour to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the custard is cooling, in a chilled medium bowl or in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream until it forms soft peaks.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to assemble, remove the custard from the refrigerator and spoon in the clotted cream over the farina base, then smooth it out with a spatula or the back of a large spoon. Next, spoon in the whipped cream and smooth. Cover and chill for another 3 to 4 hours before serving to allow the creams to set.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, drizzle the trifle with the syrup and sprinkle with the pistachios and seeds. Serve in squares from the pan or scoops from a bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">The trifle can be stored, covered in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It makes a great midnight snack or afternoon pick-me-up.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 24 pieces</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MA’AMOUL IS A</span> quintessential holiday cookie that is enjoyed for Eid, Christmas, and Easter. In its traditional form, it is made by pressing semolina cookie dough into circular molds and filling them with nut or date paste.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In our kitchen, when the holiday season rolled around, beautiful wooden molds, traditionally used for these cookies, would surface. My sisters and I would make these labor-intensive cookies with gusto. But my mother, ever efficient, often made a Fig Newton–form of cookie bar, rolling out two layers of dough to sandwich the date filling. For years, I thought this was her own invention but, it turns out, this is another form of ma’amoul called <span class="i">med</span>, which literally translates to “spread.”</p>
			<p class="rhn">The yeast in this recipe gives a little spring to the dough. As the dough rests, it becomes easier to handle and flavors develop more fully.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is my own rendition of a traditional date filling. Espresso adds depth to the date flavor, but if you are sensitive to caffeine, you can either omit it or substitute decaf espresso. The procedure here calls for soaking the dates to soften them. If your dates are already gooey and soft, you can skip this step.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I also offer an ashta cream filling variation, what many call the queen of ashta desserts in Lebanon. It is a softer, more cake-like version of the bar, since it’s drenched in syrup, and equally divine.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/245g semolina flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1⅓ cups/187g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup/60g confectioners’ sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/3g ground mahlab (see <a href="part1b.xhtml#chartlink1">this page</a>) or amaretto extract (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2g active dry yeast</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/200g melted Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or softened ghee</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups/225g pitted dates</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/15g softened Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or ghee</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/3g espresso powder</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2g ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2g orange zest</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon/2g ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="rilf">½ cup/120ml whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons/12ml orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="rilf">Confectioners’ sugar for dusting</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the flours, salt, sugar, mahlab, and yeast. Add the butter to the dry ingredients and mix by hand or in a mixer until it forms a paste. Cover with plastic wrap or a dish towel and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the flour mixture rests, immerse the dates in hot tap water and allow them to soak for about 10 minutes or until softened. Once they are soft, drain thoroughly and pulse them in the bowl of a food processor along with the butter, espresso powder, cinnamon, orange zest, and cardamom to form a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_261" role="doc-pagebreak" title="261"/>sticky paste. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 15 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">After 30 minutes, the dough will have hardened, so use a wooden spoon or other utensil such as a dough cutter to break up the dough a bit. Pour the milk and orange blossom water into the flour mixture and mix until smooth. Let stand at room temperature for another 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 300°F. Cut four sheets of parchment paper to fit an 8 by 11-inch sheet tray.</p>
			<p class="rp">Form the dough into a ball and divide it into 2 equal parts.</p>
			<p class="rp">Press half the dough onto one of the sheets of parchment. Layer a second piece of parchment on top and, using a rolling pin, roll an even ¼-inch crust to the paper’s edges. Remove the top layer of parchment and flip the dough into the sheet tray. Re-use the sheets of parchment and roll out the second ball of dough. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sandwich the date filling between two new sheets of parchment and roll into an even ¼-inch layer, out to the paper’s edges. Remove the top sheet and flip the date layer onto the dough. Remove the remaining parchment. Flip the remaining dough over the date filling and remove the final sheet of parchment.</p>
			<p class="rp">Transfer the sheet tray to the oven and bake, rotating the tray once, until the bars are light golden brown on the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven and, when it is cool enough to touch, cut the bars into 2 by 2-inch squares. Transfer the tray to a wire rack to finish cooling. When the ma’amoul is completely cool, dust with the confectioners’ sugar before serving.</p>
			<p class="rp">The bars can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

For this recipe, clarified butter is essential. My fondest memory of ghraybe is of walking through Souq al-Midan, a section of Damascus, and seeing sweet shops packed with mounds of cookies, cakes, and baklava. I was mesmerized by the shapes and sizes of all of those sweets; it took mighty self-control not to purchase every kind.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I love the cookie with its traditional pistachio stud, but for holidays I dress it up: dipped in melted chocolate for Eid or in pastel-colored white chocolate coating for Easter and for Sham El-Nasim, which is the celebration of the spring equinox and Mother’s Day in the Arab world.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Here, I offer two popular ways to shape the ghraybe: loops or mounds.</p>

			<p class="rp">To make loops: Scoop the batter onto plastic wrap in a pan or on a work surface, press it into a 4-inch block, and chill it in the refrigerator until the block firms up, about 15 minutes. Divide the block into 4 equal parts.</p>

			<p class="rp">To make mounds: Chill the batter in its bowl for about 10 minutes. Use a small ice cream scoop or soupspoon to form rounds about the size of a whole walnut. Flatten each dough ball slightly and press a pistachio into the center.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the loops or mounds on the prepared sheet trays. Bake the ghraybe until the raw sheen is gone and the cookie is baked through without browning, turning the trays at the midway point to ensure the cookies bake evenly. (The loops will take about 13 minutes and the mounds about 16 minutes.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. Resist the temptation to snack—these cookies must be fully cool before they’re eaten.</p>
			<p class="rp">The cookies can be stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MY GRANDFATHER WAS</span> a man of few words, but making knafeh became for him a language of love. Although my grandmother ruled the kitchen, this Palestinian delicacy was his pride and joy. For special occasions, he would create a golden-crusted masterpiece, enclosing hot gooey cheese and soaked with sweet syrup.</p>
			<p class="rhn">He cooked the knafeh over an open fire and knew by smell and sound just when the crust was perfect, gathering praise and appreciative murmurs from everyone around him.</p>
			<p class="rhn">There are many variations of knafeh, by country and personal preference. The Lebanese, for instance, have developed a fine bread crumb crust and clotted cream filling, while the Palestinians prefer a thinner stretchy cheese filling and a shredded phyllo crust. In the Palestinian city of Nablus, they make a variation called knafeh Nabulsiyeh, which uses orange food coloring, while the same-textured knafeh in Jordan and Syria is referred to as knafeh na’ameh (Arabic for “fine” to describe the texture of the crust), made without the orange food coloring. Over time, I’ve developed a preference for a finer crust and creamier filling, since the cheese that makes the purely cheesy version is hard to get. I mix melting cheese with Ashta (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>), or ricotta. It’s a perfect mix of my Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian identity.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Among the proudest moments in my cooking career was the day my grandfather came for his first visit to my restaurant. My grandmother had passed away the year before, and grief had dampened his appetite. He’s a man of high standards, and I watched nervously, as he slowly scooped a piece of knafeh and savored it. He turned to my mother and told her that my knafeh was even better than his.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • To make this recipe, you’ll need to soak the cheese for 4 hours or more to leach out its salt.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tips</span> • Knafeh is best eaten right out of the oven. If you want to prepare knafeh earlier in the day to serve later, cut the cheese-bake step in half (baking just long enough for the cheeses to merge into one uniform layer). Later, you can complete the bake as you would at the bottom of the recipe.</p>
			<p class="rtip2">This recipe is scaled to make use of one packet of shredded phyllo and serves a crowd, because what is knafeh, after all, without a party? If this is too much and you don’t have the trays for it, you can easily halve the recipe and save the remaining shredded phyllo in your freezer.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Crust</p>
			<p class="ril">1 packet shredded phyllo dough (about 1 pound)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup melted Clarified Butter (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or ghee, plus more for greasing the parchment</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>), cold or at room temperature, plus more for topping</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound low-moisture whole milk mozzarella or Oaxaca cheese</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound ricotta cheese, drained, or 1 recipe Clotted Cream (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rils">½ cup finely ground raw pistachios for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line one 9 by 13-inch <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266" role="doc-pagebreak" title="266"/>straight-sided sheet tray or two 10-inch cake pans with parchment paper, then grease the parchment.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the crust: Grind the phyllo in a food processor at high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until a fine crumb forms. Add in the butter and syrup and continue mixing, until the crust comes together like a dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">Press the crust into the large sheet tray or divide the crust evenly between the two cake pans. Use your fingers to press the crust into an even ¼-inch layer, allowing some of the crust to come up the sides of the tray or pans. Use the back of a soupspoon to press and smooth the crust into an even, well-packed layer; it should resemble a graham cracker piecrust.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown (take care not to let the crust burn, since it will be baking a second time with the cheese filling). Remove the tray or pans from the oven and sprinkle the lemon zest evenly over the crust. Decrease the oven temperature to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the crust is baking, taste the cheese; if it tastes salty, soak it in fresh water for up 30 minutes and drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a food processor on low speed, grind the mozzarella if your cheese is not already grated. Add in the ricotta and blend until you get a spreadable cheese.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spoon the cheese filling over the crust or divide it over the two crusts if you are using two pans. Return to the oven and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese mixture starts to form faint golden spots; you don’t want to overbake the cheese.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the pan or pans from the oven and run a knife around the edges. Cover with a serving plate and carefully flip, cheese side down. Top with the syrup and garnish with the pistachios. Serve piping hot.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I GREW UP</span> loving pecan pie, and this mixture of walnuts, dates, and spices is my homage to the legendary walnut pies that Mission Pie used to make, my predecessor at the location of my San Francisco restaurant. Lines formed around the corner for them as Thanksgiving approached each year.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Before we even opened our doors, people came knocking, asking if we had pie. Our displays of spinach, cheese, and meat turnovers weren’t quite what they had in mind. When the first holiday season rolled around, just as the pandemic was in full swing, we decided to find out what would happen if an Arab bakery provided a seasonal pie like the good ole days.</p>
			<p class="rhn">While we do not observe holidays tied to colonization, we felt some resonance with the beloved bakers at Mission Pie and with our own traditions growing up as Arabs, celebrating this odd holiday. This pie combines the spiced walnuts and dates of our holiday ma’amoul cookies, and the crust, with traces of mahlab, completes the parallel.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Crust</p>
			<p class="ril">1¼ cups plus 2 tablespoons/177g all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/10g ground mahlab (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/13g granulated sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/5g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup plus 2 tablespoons/142g chilled unsalted butter, cut into ¼-inch pieces</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup/60ml cold orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2¼ cups/225g walnut halves</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup/120ml Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/50g melted unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/5ml vanilla extract</p>
			<p class="ril">3 eggs</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/150g lightly packed brown sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/5g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/2g ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/1g ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/200g medjool dates, finely chopped</p>
			<p class="rilf">Unsalted butter for greasing the pie tin</p>
			<p class="ril">All-purpose flour for dusting</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup/240g cold heavy cream</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/125g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/15ml orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, mahlab, granulated sugar, and salt and pulse with the butter until just crumbly (about ten pulses). Slowly drizzle in the orange blossom water, pulsing until the dough just begins to come together, two or three 2-second pulses. Scrape the moistened dough crumble onto a floured surface and use your hands to bring the dough together. Flatten the dough into a 6-inch disk, about 1 inch thick, and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour or up to 3 days.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the dough is chilling, toast the walnuts at 300°F for about 25 minutes or until they are golden and fragrant. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium bowl, combine the syrup, butter, vanilla, and eggs, then whisk together with the brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom. Fold in the walnuts and dates and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_268" role="doc-pagebreak" title="268"/>Butter a 10-inch pie tin and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough, starting from the center, moving gently and evenly in each direction. Continue rotating the dough in quarter turns, sprinkling flour on top and beneath at each turn. Roll out the dough, until the disk is about 12 inches in diameter and ⅛ inch thick. It is important not to overwork the dough, so the fewer the touches and the faster you work, the better. You want your dough to remain cold.</p>
			<p class="rp">Drape the dough over the rolling pin and ease it onto the prepared pie tin. Gently press the dough onto the surface of the pan, starting at the center and working out to the rim. If the dough becomes sticky, cool it in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. Using a sharp knife, trim the excess dough away from the rim. To create a rippled rim, crimp the edge of the crust using the index finger from one hand to push the edges out into the groove between the index finger and thumb of the other hand.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Chill the dough for another 15 minutes, then line the dough with parchment paper and weight with pie weights or dried beans. This will prevent the crust from expanding when the butter creates air pockets. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the bottom crust appears completely dry. Remove the pie tin from the oven and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the filling into the crust and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the filling is set (when it doesn’t jiggle). If your crust is getting too brown, decrease the oven temperature to 300°F or cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the pie is baking, whip the cream with the granulated sugar and orange blossom water by hand or in a stand mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, until the cream is thick and fluffy. Keep the cream in the refrigerator until serving.</p>
			<p class="rp">Let the pie cool completely. Slice and serve, topped with a dollop of the whipped cream.</p>
			<p class="rp">The pie can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 16 nut-stuffed pancakes or 32 cream-stuffed pancakes</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">WHATEVER ELSE MAY</span> have been happening in our lives, when it came time to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan, we could always count on having these festive little pancake treats. We made them two ways: stuffed with nuts, folded, fried, and served hot; pinched into cone-shaped pockets for Ashta (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>) and pistachios and served cold. Unless, that is, my youngest sister, Manal, happened to be nearby. She loved to pull them straight from the pan and pop them into her mouth before they could even reach the pot of oil for frying or the fridge for cooling.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Making atayef is fun, and we usually got to help mix the batter and pinch them closed. When I exchange stories with other Arabs from the Levant, this dish, more than any other, represents Ramadan for us. Cooked only on one side, and porous with perfect, tiny, crumpet-like bubble pockets, atayef are velvety-soft receptacles for the filling and syrup to come.</p>
			<p class="rhn">At age seven, wanting to enter the world of adults around me, I took up fasting half days. Every once in a while, I’d forget I was fasting and pop a half-assembled atayef from my hand straight into my mouth. I’d be mortified at breaking my fast, but my mom, who thought I was too young to fast anyway, told me, “That’s okay. God made you forget to give you a break; your fast is not broken.”</p>
			<p class="rhn">Recipe and technique are equally important here: it’s all about getting a good seal by keeping the pancakes moist and pinching them closed. The components can each be prepared ahead of time for quick assembly before serving. I recommend making the ashta using the recipe in this book (see <a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>), since store-bought ashta tends to be too runny and does not hold as well in the pancakes.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Pancakes</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons active dry yeast</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups warm water (about 100°F)</p>
			<p class="ril">4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="ril">⅔ cup semolina flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">2 eggs</p>
			<p class="rilh">Walnut Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups walnuts</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup shredded unsweetened coconut</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon rose water</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 cups neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola, for frying, plus more for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="ril"><span class="frac">1 cup</span> Blossom Syrup (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>), plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup finely ground pistachios</p>
			<p class="rilh">Cream Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 recipes Clotted Cream (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the pancakes: Dissolve the yeast in warm water and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the yeast is blooming, in a large bowl, combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt and mix.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the yeast is frothy, combine it with the milk and eggs and whisk thoroughly. Pour the wet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_270" role="doc-pagebreak" title="270"/>ingredients into the dry and whisk vigorously until incorporated. Let sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature or store in the refrigerator, up to 1 day until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the walnut filling: In a food processor, combine the walnuts, sugar, coconut, and cinnamon and pulse until the walnuts form a fine crumble. Drizzle in the orange blossom and rose waters and pulse until just damp (two pulses should do it). Avoid overprocessing or a paste will form.</p>
			<p class="rp">To fry the pancakes: Set a sheet tray next to the stove along with a clean dish towel to cover the pancakes as they come out of the pan; keeping the pancakes moist enables the next step, sealing them.</p>
			<p class="rp">Lightly oil a nonstick pan or pancake griddle and preheat the pan over medium-low heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">For large pancakes, ladle ¼ cup batter onto the pan and swirl to form a 6-inch pancake. Remove the pancake from the heat as soon as the bottom browns, bubbles form on top, and the gloss on the batter disappears; it should be barely cooked.</p>
			<p class="rp">For smaller pancakes, use 2 tablespoons batter and follow the same process as above to form 3-inch pancakes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the pancakes cooked side down on the prepared tray and cover with the dish towel. Once the pancakes are cool, they can be stacked.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble the walnut atayefs: Bring the edges of a pancake together to form a half-moon shape and pinch into a cone. Repeat, shaping and pinching all of the pancakes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spoon 2 tablespoons walnut filling into each cone. Tamp with a finger or spoon to fill the bottom crevice. Pinch to seal the closure around the bulging center. Repeat until all of the pancakes are filled. Cover and store until ready to fry and serve.</p>
			<p class="rp">Set a wire rack over a sheet tray. Fill a small bowl with the syrup and another smaller bowl with the pistachios.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fill a medium pot two-thirds full with the oil and heat until the temperature reaches 325°F on an instant-read thermometer or until a droplet of batter sizzles on contact. Fry two half-moons at a time. When the bottoms are brown and crisp, they should float to the surface. Flip and continue to fry until both sides are done, about 4 minutes total. Remove and place on a paper towel to dab away oil.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the next batch is frying, dunk the warm atayef in the syrup. Transfer to the wire rack and sprinkle with the pistachios. Serve hot or at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble the cream atayef: Pinch the edges of a pancake halfway up, until it forms a cone. Once all the shells are formed, fill each one with the clotted cream. Keep cold until ready to serve.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, pour the pistachios on a small plate and press each cream mound into the nuts to form a crust. Then drizzle with the syrup. Serve cold or at room temperature.</p>
