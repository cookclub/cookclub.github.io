			<p class="pt">(Food) Way</p>
			<p class="cepi">Tuesdays at Reem’s had been uneventful during the summer, our slow season, awaiting the return of students and professionals from vacation. But on one bittersweet Tuesday in mid-September, we found ourselves bumping up our usual hustle, stretching hundreds of sourdough rounds and braising waist-high vats of sumac-infused chicken in anticipation of a busy service.</p>
			<p class="pf">We were preparing a farewell for our beloved leader, Rasmea Odeh, whose beaming smile greeted me as I arrived at work each morning from a lime green and hot pink technicolor mural on the biggest wall of my Oakland restaurant. In the year leading up to the opening of my restaurant, Rasmea had been singled out by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, based on immigration papers she had filed twenty years earlier. Rasmea’s example as a soft-spoken, but relentless, community organizer had helped young Palestinian activists like me face our fear of speaking out. We could not let her go without celebrating her accomplishments, even as she languished in a Detroit women’s prison.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249" role="doc-pagebreak" title="249"/>That morning, I could no longer see my feet over my pregnant belly, even needing help tying my shoes. I reached back to cinch my apron, suiting up for battle, because for some months, I’d been the target of a campaign intended to drive me out of business for my Palestinian activism. Online trolls from as far away as Tel Aviv, activated by the far-right Breitbart News Network, were calling me a terrorist and filling Yelp with one-star reviews and hate speech.</p>
			<p class="p">The aggression had grown physical, coming right to our doorstep. Just the week before, I had engaged a handful of ragtag disruptors who had proven themselves willing to cross the line into violent confrontation, shoving, hitting, and, in one instance, using a motorized chair to ram a friend who’d put her body on the line to protect my staff and me. I knew they’d be coming.</p>
			<p class="p">I pulled hot trays of golden baklava from the oven, and, as the syrup hit the hot buttery phyllo, the scents of rose and orange blossom eased my nerves. I released a long breath, realizing my friends’ imminent arrival would protect us.</p>
			<p class="p">My staff and I had worked around the clock, blending gallons of chickpeas into hummus and roasting and peeling crates of red bell peppers for our sweet-and-tart muhammara spread. With fragrant olive oil from California’s hot Central Valley at the ready, we set up our stations to plate our mezze for the hundreds of guests we were expecting.</p>
			<p class="p">My comrade Lara was on her way, along with Arab youth from a program she’d built. She had also put out a call to many of the Black- and Brown-led organizations we had worked with to protest the Muslim ban at San Francisco International Airport and to end programs like Urban Shield, which equipped police with military gear and training. These were the same police forces that had killed Oscar Grant, the young Black man who’d been celebrating New Year’s Eve almost a decade before on the transit platform right above Reem’s. And not coincidentally, these were the same forces who had cross-trained and shared intelligence and equipment with an Israeli military that had imprisoned and tortured Rasmea in her youth.</p>
			<p class="p">The first to arrive that day were Ellen and Sara, progressive Jewish community leaders who put olives on their Seder plates at Passover to invoke a free Palestine. They had spent months challenging fake reviews on Reem’s Yelp page, fielding hate messages and writing op-eds about what Reem’s meant to them—a safe space for people to come as they are, celebrate Palestinian culture, and draw strength from one another. I loaded freshly ground beans into the espresso machine to welcome them in the most Arab way possible, with hot cups of coffee to fortify us for the day ahead.</p>
			<p class="p">At opening time, a stream of customers formed at the register. It was only 11:00 a.m. I could feel the heat of our hearth on my back, as I started to fire orders for mana’eesh and salatet fattoush. In minutes, our ticket rail was full, and the room was starting to buzz.</p>
			<p class="p">By noon, Lara arrived along with fifteen rowdy youths, whose roots traced to Yemen, Egypt, and Palestine; they were sporting embroidered keffiyeh scarves over the latest denim and Nike kicks. My friend Eman, DJ Emancipation, who, years before, had welcomed me to Arab feminist protest lines, set up her turntables and cranked up Arab hip-hop tunes. My team had reserved tables for the youth, but they weren’t about to sit still. They were riled up by a flyer they’d seen on the way in that called me “the butcher, the baker.”</p>
			<p class="p">They didn’t know that Lara, Ellen, Sara, and I had spent weeks learning de-escalation tactics from Black and Latinx experts in a technique called community safety, developed to keep people safe from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250" role="doc-pagebreak" title="250"/>the police and vigilantes. We had learned that when someone shouts in your face, you take a breath and plant your feet and call on the strength of your ancestors to face the violence with calm. You never meet aggression with the same. You use good old-fashioned jujitsu to redirect violence away from yourself and others at risk. Turha, our teacher, had assigned us the best possible security detail from his team for that day—Che, a six-foot Black vegan, who was happy to be paid in mana’eesh.</p>
			<p class="p">I tried to assure the youth that we could handle whatever might be coming our way that day. Still, no amount of training could hide a shudder of nerves that tightened my jaw.</p>
			<p class="p">Soon, the place was packed, and people were milling about in search of seats. My soccer crew, Left Wing Fútbol Club, whose politics were cleverly embedded right in the name, took up a whole rowdy section, excited about the feast and primed by years of activism and anti-war protests to offer us protection.</p>
			<p class="p">My husband, J (his name is a shortened version of his family nickname J. R.), arrived just in the nick of time. He and I had met on the soccer pitch. Sunday with our soccer team was our church day. Our love story had unfolded over potlucks with elaborate spreads, representing the cultures of our bunch, from Indonesian jackfruit stew to Mexican grilled corn, smothered in crema and Cotija cheese. J’s and my love of food, hospitality, and making “good trouble” rooted us in our Arab and Filipino cultures. Tapping into those roots (and crowd-control skills he had honed from years spent in the kindergarten classroom), he let people know where to go and brought them snacks and drinks to ease the wait. By the time he’d moved through the restaurant, everybody was laughing and having so much fun that they had forgotten about the thirty-minute wait time for a man’oushe.</p>
			<p class="p">I made my way to the courtyard to take stock. I was raw from months of dread and fear, compulsively scrolling through social media to see what threats lay in store, shocked anew at lines like “A good Arab is a dead Arab.” In the distance, I heard a familiar commotion, the sounds of disruptive shouting.</p>
			<p class="p">As if on cue, Eman upped the volume, and the speakers thumped out heavy bass notes. Arab youth spontaneously linked hands to start a dabke line, our traditional dance for special occasions but also a dance Palestinians had taken up during the intifada to assert our existence in the face of violent aggression from Israeli occupying forces. Dancing, much like food, feeds our spirit.</p>
			<p class="p">I smiled as the crowd clapped and cheered. People drawn from their commute stopped to watch. Even people I didn’t recognize got in on the fun, finding a spot to slip into the line as it wound through the courtyard, gradually picking up the footwork. Our resistance became our joy. And those who wished us harm no longer mattered. It was hard to tell they were even there.</p>
			<p class="p">I threaded my way through the dining room to check on my cooks, who were busier than they had ever been, and I realized, at the sight of mezze platters and wraps growing cold, that our servers were busy bussing tables. Catching my worried gaze, several white lefties wearing “Jewish Voice for Peace” T-shirts, their gray hair pulled back in ponytails, approached the counter and offered to run our dishes to tables. Without hesitation, I replied, “Table 10, please.”</p>
			<p class="p">I stepped back to take it all in and soon found myself backed all the way to the farthest nook of the kitchen. Tucked away among sacks of potatoes, relief and exhaustion coursing through me, I had a good, long cry.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251" role="doc-pagebreak" title="251"/>People from many parts of my life—from my poker league to grassroots leaders on whose doors I had once knocked—came together that day to protect me like a force field. They weren’t there just for me or for our sourdough man’oushe but rather to defend a place that had provided them with a sense of warmth and belonging, a feeling that extended even to people I didn’t know. Customers were arriving not only by train from across the bay but even straight from the airport, luggage in tow, to experience Reem’s. My community had grown larger than I had ever dreamed.</p>
			<p class="p">I gathered myself together and made my way to the mural that had ignited a new level of consciousness about the Palestinian struggle, and I looked up at Rasmea’s reassuring smile. Just then, an elder tapped me on the shoulder, and, speaking in Arabic, he said, “Thanks for putting her on your wall. I wouldn’t have had the guts.” I nodded, reflecting on what his generation had endured and the path they had paved. I recognized that I was widening that path for the child kicking in my belly.</p>
			<p class="p">I turned around to look at all of the faces in the room, some familiar and some new, taking a moment to enjoy this refuge. My stand for justice had allowed me to create a space where each one of us could feel safe and whole, including myself. Here, where the man’oushe meets the movement, I had finally found my purpose.</p>
