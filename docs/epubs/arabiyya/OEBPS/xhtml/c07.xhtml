			<p class="ry">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IN MY EARLIEST</span> food memories, my mom is frying leftover bread into an addictive crunchy snack, a topping for soups or, more often than not, croutons for fattoush. Although I loved the chips, I fault the tasteless trucked-in tomatoes for my childhood aversion to the salad, an aversion I abandoned the first time I tasted field-fresh tomatoes in California. There’s no need to forgo this staple of the Palestinian dinner table when tomatoes fall out of season, since citrus makes a great winter substitute.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The medley of vegetables is what makes fattoush so special. If you’re not a purist, you can make it a medley of anything. Mine has all the elements of a delicious balanced salad: mustardy arugula, Little Gem or romaine lettuce for crunch, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, spicy radishes, and fresh herbs. This base welcomes seasonal additions. In the summer, I add corn—grilled or raw—pomegranate seeds, pickled cherries, or fresh purslane. In the winter, I swap segments of Cara Cara oranges and other citrus and fried sunchokes in place of tomatoes. In the spring, I look for varieties of radishes, including Easter Egg, Ninja, and French Breakfast to mix things up a little.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Dressing</p>
			<p class="ril">1 garlic clove, crushed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="rilh">Salad</p>
			<p class="ril">3 cups store-bought pita chips or 2-inch pieces of pita bread, fried</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups halved cherry tomatoes</p>
			<p class="ril">1 Persian cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into ⅛-inch crescents (about 1 cup)</p>
			<p class="ril">4 radishes, sliced into thin rounds</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ red onion, halved stem to root and thinly sliced into crescents (about 1 cup)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups Little Gem lettuce or chopped Romaine</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups loosely packed arugula</p>
			<p class="ril">Leaves from 2 sprigs of parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">Leaves from 2 sprigs of mint</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon sumac</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the dressing: Combine all of the ingredients in a blender or a bowl and mix or whisk to incorporate. Make sure to whisk well again before using, since the oil will separate.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble the salad: In a medium bowl, toss half the chips with the tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, onion, Little Gem, and ¼ cup of the dressing.</p>
			<p class="rp">Lay the arugula on a serving platter and cover evenly with the dressed veggies and chips. Tuck the remaining half of the pita chips into the salad to fill in any gaps. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the salad. Sprinkle the parsley and mint over the dish and top with the sumac.</p>

			<p class="rt">Beet and Kishk Salad</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I LOVE THE</span> way the funk of kishk, fermented yogurt and bulgur, offsets a beet’s natural sugars in the same way gorgonzola or blue cheese might but with the added bonus of yogurt’s sour notes. It can be served warm or chilled.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Kishk is versatile. It can be made a day in advance for a headier mix or a few hours ahead for a milder, crumbly goat cheese–like flavor. With a dash more salt, it can be made to resemble feta.</p>
			<p class="rhn">While recipe testing for this book, my dear friend and talented chef Michelle Minori was inspired to give this salad even more of an Arab flair and developed a brilliant recipe for the spiced candied walnuts.</p>
			<p class="rilf">3 or 4 beets (about 1 pound)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">Kosher salt for seasoning the beets</p>
			<p class="rilh">Candied Walnuts</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup walnut halves or pieces</p>
			<p class="ril">6 tablespoons sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground coriander</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rilh">Vinaigrette</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup finely diced shallot (about ½ shallot)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup finely chopped cilantro</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup finely chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon finely diced garlic (about 1 clove)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup champagne vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="rilf">8 cups arugula (about 6 ounces)</p>
			<p class="ril">⅔ cup Fermented Yogurt and Bulgur (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_47">this page</a>) or crumbly cheese, such as chevre, feta, or ricotta salata</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Coat the beets with the oil and season heavily with the salt. Place the beets in a baking pan and fill with 1 inch of water. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and roast the beets for about 1½ hours or until they can easily be pierced with a knife. Set aside to cool. When the beets are cool enough to handle, rub away the skins with gloved hands or peel with a paring knife. Cut into ¼-inch wedges.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the candied walnuts: While the beets are roasting, in a small pan, toss the walnuts in the sugar over low heat, until the sugar begins to turn golden brown and coats the nuts. Keep tossing to encourage the nuts to take on an even golden-brown color. Once the sugar begins to harden and stick to the nuts, add the butter and immediately sprinkle on the sumac, Aleppo pepper, coriander, and salt. Mix with a wooden spoon over low heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool before serving on the salad.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the vinaigrette: Whisk together all of the ingredients in a bowl. Alternately, pulse them together in a food processor or blender.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble: Spread the arugula on the bottom of a broad, shallow serving bowl, layer on the beet wedges, sprinkle with the fermented yogurt and bulgur and walnuts, and drizzle with the vinaigrette.</p>

			<p class="rt">Gazan Tomato Salsa</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SPICY, HERBY, TOMATOEY,</span> and fresh, fresh, fresh—those are the hallmarks of a daa’a Ghazaweeya, the salsa-like salad I used to eat with every breakfast, back when we could still get across the border to see our family in Gaza. I remember scooping it up with bread, along with the many other breakfast mezze dishes on my family’s table, while watching the 1994 World Cup on TV, playing, ironically, in cities across the United States. To this day, I associate the dish with Brazil’s cherished place in the hearts of Arab soccer lovers.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Daa’a, which in Arabic means “pounded,” is traditionally mashed in a mortar and pestle to infuse the flavors quickly and effectively, but you can easily get the same effect by mixing all of the prepared ingredients and letting them sit for a few hours in the fridge.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Since daa’a is eaten with Arab meals mostly as a condiment, the portions are fairly small.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 heaping cups finely diced tomatoes (about 4 tomatoes)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill (about 5 sprigs)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heaping teaspoons minced garlic (about 4 cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heaping teaspoons minced serrano chile (about 1 chile)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons dill seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rpf">Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for a few hours and serve when the flavors have melded into a salsa-like consistency.</p>

				<p class="sbt">Gaza after the Peace Accord</p>
				<p class="sb">In 1994, as the world celebrated the road map for peace that was negotiated under the Oslo Accords, my mom saw a window of opportunity and packed us off to meet our family in Gaza. All around our family’s neighborhood, the farm fields, roadways, and buildings bore the marks of bombings and military occupation. I could see people’s relief at being able to walk the streets without bumping into the butts of rifles and the Israeli soldiers who carried them, but there was also a lingering sadness because people recognized that their leaders’ concessions had left them in a kind of purgatory with little hope for a free Palestine.</p>
				<p class="sb">Behind the rubble of home fronts smashed in by tanks, families hosted us with lavish meals. I’m not sure how they managed this, given the food shortages at the time. Even water had to be purchased from Israel, since bombardments had taken out Gaza’s water treatment plants. At the age of eleven, I felt both comforted and self-conscious at the same time, realizing deeply that I was not just an American kid but a child of refugees. I was a stranger yearning to belong, and yet even a dose of my family’s day-to-day reality under military rule was enough to send me back home to the States, never wanting to return there until Gaza was once again free.</p>

			<p class="ry">Serves 4 to 6</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MULTICOLORED, HERB-RICH</span> tabbouli is a mainstay of the Arab American plate both at home and in eateries. If you’ve sampled various tabbouli, you know that they are not all created equal. Two things set this bright, vibrant tabbouli apart from other contenders. First and most importantly, herbs must be handled like royalty.</p>
			<p class="rp">My earliest memories of tabbouli involve my grandmother—carefully supervising my younger sister Dalyah as they prepared for the day’s main afternoon meal. She showed her tricks that I would later learn as a chef: bunch the herbs together under the weight of your knuckles, easing them back in tiny increments, to guide a sharp blade in nice, clean, strokes to produce finely minced shards.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Second is texture: Tabbouli combines a soft fruit with a crunchy vegetable. I love fennel and citrus together, and so, too, I think, does Mother Nature, who gave us these two gifts in the winter months when tomatoes and cucumbers are out of season.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • Thoroughly dry the herbs after washing; discard all of the stems and use only the leaves. As for the olive oil, this is an occasion to splurge on your fruitiest, highest-quality oil.</p>
			<p class="rilf">⅓ cup bulgur #1 (fine size)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 medium oranges</p>
			<p class="ril">1 small fennel bulb, small diced, with fronds reserved for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup finely chopped red onions (about ½ onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups finely chopped parsley (about 1½ bunches)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup finely chopped mint (about 1 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215" role="doc-pagebreak" title="215"/>bunch)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="ril">2 garlic cloves, finely minced</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon sumac, plus a pinch for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">4 heads Little Gem lettuce or 1 head romaine</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small bowl, cover the bulgur with hot water and set aside for 15 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, zest the oranges and set aside for garnish.</p>
			<p class="rp">Peel the oranges or use a sharp knife to cut away the peels. Use a sharp knife to cut the oranges into segments and dice the segments into bite-size pieces. Toss the diced segments into a large bowl and add the fennel, onions, parsley, and mint.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain the excess water from the bulgur and then add it to the bowl with the oranges, vegetables, and herbs.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add in the lemon juice, oil, molasses, garlic, sumac, salt, and pepper and mix thoroughly. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve in one large bowl, or individually, with the lettuce leaves wedged beneath the salad’s perimeter. Garnish with the orange zest, fennel fronds, and more sumac.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS RECIPE IS</span> inspired by my aunt Emily’s love for seasonal salads. When I first went to live with her and my uncle in San Francisco, it was the prime season for fresh favas. She always found a way to incorporate them into dishes.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This salad does beautifully with an array of fresh herbs including parsley and minced chives. Fresh favas are delicious but laborious; choose your own adventure by substituting frozen soybeans or peas, depending on time and availability.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The length of time needed to cook fresh beans and peas increases as the season progresses. Early in the season, they cook beautifully in the heat of the grains, as they’re draining in the colander. Later in the season, as the sugars convert to starches, the beans and peas need a quick boil to sweeten up; adjust accordingly.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ cups wheat berries or farro</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup walnuts</p>
			<p class="ril">Neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola, for coating the pan</p>
			<p class="ril">4 ounces Halloumi cheese, cut into ⅛-inch slices</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ red onion, thinly sliced</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons white vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heaping cups fresh or frozen fava beans, soybeans, or peas</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon minced preserved lemon peel (about ¼ of a preserved lemon); optional</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">Freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup thinly sliced mint (about 4 sprigs)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water boils, add the wheat berries, turn down the heat to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 1 hour. (If you are using farro, cook for about 20 minutes.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, toast the walnuts at 325°F for about 12 minutes or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">Warm a medium skillet over medium-high heat with enough oil to coat the pan. Gently slide the cheese slices into the skillet to minimize spatter. Cook for 1 minute on each side or until the cheese turns dark golden-brown and the surface crisps. Transfer the slices to a plate. Set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small bowl, toss the onion with the vinegar and the salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">If the beans need cooking, add them to the pot with the grains a few minutes before they finish cooking. Otherwise, add them to the grains as they drain. Stir to disperse evenly and gently cook the beans. Drain in a colander and transfer to a medium bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Drain the onion slices and place them in the bowl with the grains. Add the lemon peel, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, pepper, and mint and toss. Adjust the pepper to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, transfer the salad to a serving bowl. Using your hands, crush the walnuts, crumble the fried Halloumi, and sprinkle them on top of the salad. The cheese and onion add salinity; taste before adding more salt.</p>

			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I LOVE WHIPPING</span> up this salad with crunchy chunks of cucumber, a little garlic zing, and enough yogurt to have some left over as a condiment. It goes with just about everything.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Each element contributes a cooling effect, creating a nice balance with Arab food’s warming spices, a relationship that I imagine might trace back to Ayurvedic practices and Indian raita, which is prepared in much the same way. Arabs love eating this salad with rice or meat dishes. After a long day, I sometimes wonder, is there anything better than a hearty bowl of Mujaddarra (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_167">this page</a>), topped with this salad?</p>
			<p class="rhn">Since khyar bi laban is eaten with Arab meals mostly as a condiment, the portions are fairly small.

			<p class="rt">Palestinian Braised Dandelion Greens</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">HINDBEH, OUR TRADITIONAL</span> dish of dandelion greens, is all about the perfect balance of candy-like caramelized onions, bitter greens, and bright fresh lemon juice. And therein lies the secret of Palestinian cuisine: make a complex dish with just a handful of ingredients. Throw in some heat, and you have a winner!</p>
			<p class="rhn">While I only discovered them in California at a farmers’ market, it turns out dandelion greens, edible from root to flower, are a staple Palestinian ingredient, that is often foraged in the wild. When my mother revealed this to me, I almost felt deceived that I had been kept in the dark for that long about the traditions she had grown up with. Picking wild plants became political when the Israeli government began to ban foraging in the occupied territories under the pretext of conservation, separating Palestinians from their culinary traditions and modes of survival. I think about this whenever I see dandelion greens come into season. Cooking them helps connect me to the traditions of my people.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The key to this recipe is sweating the onions over medium-low heat so caramelization brings out their natural sugars. Blanching the braised greens prevents them from overcooking and preserves their gorgeous bright color. You want the greens wilted so you can bite through them easily but not so broken down that they lose their form and nutrition.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This dish works beautifully as a side, but it’s meant to be eaten as a mezze, scooped with bread.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • If dandelion greens are unavailable, substitute mustard or collard greens.</p>

			<p class="rp">In a large pan, caramelize the onions in the oil over medium-low heat, until they’re a deep golden color throughout, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally since the bottoms will brown.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the greens in the water until they are wilted, about 2 minutes (less if early in the season when the greens are most tender and more when they toughen later in the season).

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS EGG-ADORNED ASPARAGUS</span>, covered in spiced bread crumbs, is inspired by an Indian asparagus dish my friend chef Preeti Mistry served at my Oakland restaurant as part of a collaboration for La Cocina’s annual Week of Women in Food in 2018. During the event, I was in prodromal labor: I’d begun and then stopped contractions weeks before and could no longer see my feet. It was time to have this baby, and I returned again and again for helpings of Preeti’s spicy asparagus in an effort to induce labor. Four hours later, it did the trick, and baby Zain was born.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Rich, soft yolks complement this charred herby asparagus. Pita bread crumbs, pan-fried the traditional Italian way in olive oil, add a rich, deep flavor. It’s perfect for a spring dinner side or mezze. Feel free to up the heat by swapping in a higher Scoville pepper for the Aleppo, whether you’re trying to induce the birth of a reluctant baby or you just like things spicy.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This dish is also a great way to use up bread that’s gone dry.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Garlic-Lemon Sauce</p>
			<p class="ril">1 garlic head</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons water</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="rilh">Bread Crumbs</p>
			<p class="ril">1 round of pita, toasted, or ½ cup bread crumbs</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley (about 5 sprigs)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">Freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 eggs</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound asparagus (1 bunch), trimmed and cut on the bias into 3- to 4-inch pieces</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon Za’atar (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_24">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the sauce: Separate the cloves from the garlic head and then peel. Place the cloves in a small pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, then drain. Repeat, blanching the garlic a second time.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a blender, puree the garlic with the lemon juice, salt, and water until completely smooth. Drizzle in the oil, until the mixture is thick and emulsified (like a hollandaise sauce). Adjust the salt to taste. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the bread crumbs: In a food processor or spice grinder, pulse the pita to a fine crumb. (If you already have bread crumbs, skip this step.)</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221" role="doc-pagebreak" title="221"/>Sauté the bread crumbs in the oil over medium heat until crunchy, about 5 minutes. You should add enough oil to lightly coat the bread crumbs.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the lemon zest, Aleppo pepper, parsley, salt, and black pepper. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Prepare a bowl of ice water and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small saucepan, bring water to a roaring boil. Use a spoon to gently lower the eggs into the water and cook for 6 minutes. Then plunge the boiled eggs immediately into the prepared ice water. Allow the eggs to cool, then peel and halve the eggs lengthwise. Let the eggs come to room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a large bowl, toss the asparagus with the oil, za’atar, salt, and black pepper. In a medium cast-iron skillet or heavy pan, sauté the asparagus over high heat until tender and charred in spots, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, scatter the warm asparagus on a platter and drizzle with the sauce. Place the egg halves yolk side up decoratively across the plate and sprinkle with the bread crumbs. Serve immediately as a side or a mezze dish.</p>

			<p class="rt">Green Beans in Tomato Reduction</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">GREEN BEANS BATHED</span> in Arab-spiced tomato sauce are a staple of my childhood. The dish is easy to make and works equally well as a mezze or vegetarian main dish.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Beans are the star of the show: tomato sauce, caramelized in its own natural sugars, makes the beans pop. When I moved to California, I discovered all kinds of beans, and I love to mix things up with seasonal varietals. In summer, I look for the reddest, sweetest Roma tomatoes, and in winter, canned whole tomatoes do nicely. A hit of lemon and drizzle of olive oil at the end ties this beautiful dish together.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mom liked to stew canned tomatoes down, until most of the water had evaporated and a thick, sweet paste clung to the beans. If using canned tomatoes, skip the oven roasting and add them directly to the caramelized onion-garlic mixture. I like my sauce blended and strained, but you can keep it chunky, with all the goods, if you like.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • When in season, substitute yellow wax beans for half the green beans to create a colorful effect.</p>
			<p class="rilf">5 cups ripe Roma tomatoes (about 12 tomatoes), sliced lengthwise</p>
			<p class="ril">1 serrano chile, stems, seeds, and veins removed (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups medium-diced yellow onions (about 2 onions)</p>
			<p class="ril">Kosher salt as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons minced garlic (about 8 cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted and ground, or ½ teaspoon ground</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or sunflower</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound green beans, trimmed and halved lengthwise at a diagonal (about 4 cups)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">Maldon salt (optional) for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 450°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">On a sheet tray, rub the tomatoes and chile with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Roast in the oven until the skins are black and blistered, 50 to 55 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, in a heavy saucepan, sauté the onions in the remaining ⅓ cup of olive oil along with a generous pinch of salt on medium-low heat, until the onions are lightly caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. As the onions darken, stir to keep from burning.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the garlic is fragrant and soft, add the coriander, charred tomatoes and chile, and another pinch of salt. If the tomatoes are dry, add enough water to barely cover (about 1 cup).</p>
			<p class="rp">Raise the heat to bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain the simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 25 to 35 minutes or until the tomatoes break down completely. I prefer a smooth sauce without fragments of tomato or pepper skins, so I run mine through a high-powered blender or strain it, but that’s optional.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223" role="doc-pagebreak" title="223"/>In a medium pan over medium-low heat, warm the neutral oil. When the oil shimmers, add the beans, another pinch of salt, and the pepper and cook for 7 to 10 minutes or until the beans are softened. Then add the tomato sauce and lemon juice and mix thoroughly.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, transfer the beans to a serving plate. Drizzle with olive oil and top with Maldon salt and pepper.</p>

			<p class="rt">Pumpkin-Bulgur Casserole</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about 20 pieces</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IN THIS VEGETARIAN</span> dish, spiced pumpkin and bulgur dough encases a filling of brightly flavored chard, red onions, sumac, and pomegranate molasses. <span class="i">Kibbet</span> in Arabic simply means “kibbeh of [insert your favorite ingredient here],” and Arabs often switch up meat kibbeh with vegetarian alternatives such as potato, tomato, squash, or, in this case, pumpkin. Perfect for a snack, mezze, or main, kibbeh is delicious any time of the day.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mother remembers Catholic friends and neighbors forgoing meat every Friday for the forty days of Lent. This dish makes a lovely main when accompanied with Taratoor (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_39">this page</a>) and Salatet Fattoush (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_211">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rhn">Most kibbeh recipes call for presoaking the bulgur before mixing it with the binder. I skip this step, since pumpkin puree has enough water content to hydrate the bulgur.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • Your pumpkin or squash may come in various sizes, so you may have to adjust your bulgur ratios accordingly. My rule of thumb is 1.5:1 on the pulp-to-bulgur ratio in weight.</p>
			<p class="rilf">¾ cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, or one 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">Pinch of baking soda</p>
			<p class="ril">1 small sugar pumpkin or acorn, kabocha, or butternut squash (about 2½ pounds)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups finely chopped red onions (about 1 onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 bunch rainbow chard, stems removed and coarsely chopped (about 4 cups packed leaves)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>) or ground allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>); optional</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons pomegranate seeds (optional)</p>
			<p class="rilh">Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">1 onion, grated</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>); optional</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups bulgur #1 (fine size)</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
			<p class="rilf">Neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola, for greasing the pan</p>
			<p class="ril">Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">Lemon wedges for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">If using dried chickpeas, place the chickpeas in a small pot with the baking soda and cover the beans with about 6 inches of clean water. Bring to a boil, skim, discard the residue from the water’s surface, and decrease the heat to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, uncovered, until the beans soften, about 30 minutes. Test for doneness by squeezing a bean between your thumb and forefinger.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Halve the pumpkin from base to stem; scrape away and discard the seeds. Rub the inside with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Place skin side down on a sheet tray, place in the oven, and roast for about an hour or until the flesh is soft when pierced with a fork and the skin peels away easily. Once the pumpkin is cool, scoop out the flesh.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the pumpkin is cooking, warm the neutral oil over medium heat in a medium pan and sauté the onions, stirring them often, until they have softened and are slightly caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the chard, sumac, spice mix, Aleppo pepper, salt, and black pepper and cook until the chard has softened. Stir in the chickpeas, molasses, and pomegranate seeds and continue to sauté for another 5 minutes on medium heat until the flavors come together. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Let cool completely.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the dough: Soak the grated onion in the lemon juice while the filling cools.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the bowl of a food processor, combine the pumpkin pulp, lemon-soaked onion, salt, pepper, spice mix, cinnamon, and Aleppo pepper and blend until smooth.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_225" role="doc-pagebreak" title="225"/>Add the bulgur to the mix and pulse until fully incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle the mix with the flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and knead until it forms a wet-dough-like consistency. It should hold together when you squeeze it. (If your dough is not holding together, add more flour.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Generously grease a 10-inch springform pan or a 8-inch square casserole dish with the neutral oil and spread out 1 portion of dough, patting and smoothing it into an even layer about ¼ inch thick.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spread the filling evenly across the dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">Wet your palms with cold water and shape small handfuls of the remaining dough into ¼-inch-thick patties and distribute evenly across the filling. Patch any gaps with more dough, using your fingers to spread and smooth, until the entire surface is covered. Chill your fingers in cold water, as needed, to keep them from sticking to the dough. Chill the kibbeh for about 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">With a sharp knife, score the kibbeh into parallelograms (four lines across and four lines diagonal), making sure to cut through all of the layers down to the bottom of the pan. Dipping your knife in cold water each time will help keep the knife from sticking. Drizzle with olive oil and brush evenly using a pastry brush.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 35 minutes or until the edges turn golden. Turn the heat to broil and watch carefully until the crust turns deep golden, about 5 minutes.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 8 to 10 servings as the main event</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MA‘LOUBA IS A</span> layered Palestinian rice dish; its name means “upside down” in Arabic. Flipping the pot to reveal its contents is the moment of truth. Will it stand upright, revealing a tower of rice layered with mosaics of vegetables? If not, just remember the first spoonful will send it cascading into the serving tray anyway.</p>
			<p class="rhn">No two ma‘loubas are alike. While I was growing up, we had it Gazan-style with eggplant and lamb. In California, Palestinians from the West Bank insist that chicken and carrots make the ultimate ma‘louba. While disputes rage on the best proteins and veggies from village to village, family to family even, devotion to this dish unites all Palestinians, both within Palestine and in the diaspora.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I’ve opted for a version of this dish that places vegetables in the star role. You can use just about any vegetable.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I’ve offered a fairly traditional method of preparation, but there are several ways to simplify this dish. It may seem like a lot of frying, but it goes quickly, and it’s the best way to get the caramelized flavor we’re looking for. And if you fry hot enough, your veggies shouldn’t feel or taste oily at all.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • If you prefer not to fry, toss the vegetables in neutral cooking oil, such as sunflower or canola, add a sprinkle of salt, and roast at 425°F until sizzling and golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ cups basmati rice</p>
			<p class="ril">1 large globe eggplant, sliced into ¼-inch rounds (about 1 pound)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup cornstarch</p>
			<p class="ril">1 russet potato with skin, sliced into ¼-inch rounds</p>
			<p class="ril">2 large carrots, cut on the bias into ¼-inch rounds (about 2 cups)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 head cauliflower, broken into 1½-inch florets (about 4 cups)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 red bell peppers or 3 or 4 small mixed bell peppers, sliced into ¼-inch strips</p>
			<p class="rilh">Cooking Liquid</p>
			<p class="ril">4 cups water or vegetable stock, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rilf">Neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola, for greasing</p>
			<p class="ril">2 Roma tomatoes, sliced into ¼-inch rounds</p>
			<p class="ril">4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup slivered almonds, toasted</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt or Yogurt, Mint, and Cucumber Salad (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_218">this page</a>) for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">Rinse the rice and soak for 30 minutes. Drain well.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, sprinkle the eggplant with 1 tablespoon of the salt and set aside for 5 minutes to release some of its water (and some bitterness along with it).</p>
			<p class="rp">Line two sheet trays with paper towels.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the oil into a large pan, until the oil is deep enough to immerse a layer of the vegetables, about 2 inches, and warm over medium-high heat. The oil is the right temperature if the vegetables sizzle and swim around immediately and slowly brown while cooking. If using an instant-read thermometer, heat the oil to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Pat the rounds of eggplant dry with a paper towel, coat both sides in cornstarch, and gently lower them into the oil, filling a single layer. Fry in batches until golden, about a minute on each side. Set the rounds on the prepared sheet trays to drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fry the potato, a single layer at a time, until brown. The potato rounds should be lightly golden and about halfway cooked; set aside to drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fry the carrots, a single layer at a time, until the surface bubbles and browns slightly; set aside to drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fry the cauliflower, a single layer at a time, until the florets are crispy and brown; set aside to drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fry the bell peppers, a single layer at a time, until they curl and brown; set aside to drain. The carrots, cauliflower, and bell peppers need to take on a browned color but stay al dente.</p>
			<p class="rp">Use the remaining 1 tablespoon salt to season the vegetables after they’re fried.</p>
			<p class="rp">To prepare the cooking liquid: Add the water to a small pot and bring to a simmer. Add the spice mix, turmeric, salt, and black pepper and maintain a simmer.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228" role="doc-pagebreak" title="228"/>When ready to assemble, brush the bottom and sides of a large straight-sided pot (a 3-quart Dutch oven works great) with oil. In concentric circles, layer half the eggplant, carrots, potato, tomatoes, bell peppers, and cauliflower, in that order. Sprinkle half of the rice on the first vegetable layer. Repeat the layering with the second round of vegetables and sprinkle the remaining rice on top. Scatter the garlic across the top.</p>
			<p class="rp">Gently pour in the spiced stock, taking care not to disturb the vegetables and rice; you want to keep the layers intact. Add more water if necessary to ensure the rice is at least ½ inch below the waterline. Over medium heat, return the pot to a simmer, taking care not to reach a vigorous boil, which might displace the layering. Turn down the heat to low, place a heavy plate smaller than the pot as a weight on top to keep the layered rice tower compact, and cover with a tightly fitted lid. Cook for 30 to 45 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked.</p>
			<p class="rp">Turn off the heat and let the pot rest for 10 to 15 minutes, then remove the lid and plate and cover the pot with a large flat-bottomed platter. Using oven mitts, sandwich the pot with one hand on the platter and the other beneath the bottom and quickly flip the pot upside down so it rests on the platter.</p>
			<p class="rp">Now comes a little luck and superstition: thump the bottom of the pot with the base of your palm or a wooden spoon and give the rice a few minutes to slide down to the platter. Carefully jimmy the pot directly upward and, if all goes well, the rice and vegetables will retain the shape of the pot to form a layered tower.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle with the almonds and parsley. Serve warm with a side of plain yogurt or with the yogurt-cucumber salad.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS DISH IS</span> spectacular: herbed and spiced rice is tightly enclosed in grape leaves, packed together in concentric rings, then topped with scalloped potatoes and held together with a thin layer of caramelized tomatoes.</p>
			<p class="rhn">When I think of stuffed grape leaves, I think immediately of my sister Dalyah. She was the master wrapper and my grandmother’s right hand when it came to this labor of love. I, on the other hand, always found a way out of rolling the leaves into little rice-stuffed cigars. I lacked the patience. I even tried rolling the leaves using a little gadget my mom ordered off a late-night infomercial, but mine never came out as neatly wrapped as the ones my sister rolled by hand.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mother made this dish for special occasions, steamed in a pressure cooker. Luckily, she was able to outsource much of the work to my sister.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe works equally well with fresh or preserved grape leaves. For leaves from a jar, soak them in warm water for about 5 minutes and rinse well to remove the brine. My mother was an expert forager and could find fresh leaves as close as our neighbor’s backyard in early spring. If using fresh leaves, submerge them in boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes until softened and then plunge them in ice water to prevent further cooking. Drain, stack, and cover the prepared grape leaves for assembly.</p>

			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Rinse the rice until the water runs clear, then immerse in water and soak for 30 minutes to an hour. Drain.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: In a large bowl, combine the rice, parsley, onions, tomatoes, salt, Aleppo pepper, spice mix, molasses, and oil. Mix with a spoon or your hands. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to assemble the prepared grape leaves, grab a leaf that doesn’t have too many tears or holes. Place it smooth side down (vein side up) with the tip pointing away from you. With a paring knife, make two slits around the stem and pull in the leaves to overlap so that you have a straight base.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place 1 tablespoon of the filling in a thin horizontal line across the base of the leaf. Fold the bottom of the grape leaf over the filling and roll tightly to midway. Fold the right and left sides inward toward the middle, tightly encasing the stuffing; continue rolling upward until you have a tightly rolled cylinder. Repeat until you’ve used up all of the filling. You may need to strain away some of the liquid as you’re filling, since the onions and tomatoes will release some liquid as you work. Reserve the liquid for cooking the grape leaves.</p>
			<p class="rp">Drizzle the oil into a Dutch oven or a heavy pot and layer in all of the potatoes in concentric circles, followed by all of the tomatoes. Sprinkle the vegetable layer with salt, paprika, and Aleppo pepper.</p>
			<p class="rp">Snugly pack the stuffed grape leaves in concentric circles on top of the layers of vegetables. Arrange each layer of stuffed grape leaves perpendicular to the one beneath it. Repeat until all are lined up in the pot.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_230" role="doc-pagebreak" title="230"/>In a separate medium pot, combine the reserved juice from the filling and water to make 3½ cups of liquid. Add the spice mix, molasses, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, then pour over the grape leaves and cover the Dutch oven or pot with its lid. Simmer on low heat for 1 to 1½ hours or until cooked through and very little liquid remains.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the pot from the heat, then uncover and drizzle the grape leaves with the lemon juice.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, flip the pot onto a serving platter and let it sit upside down for a minute or two while the grape leaves and vegetables ease out. Gently lift the pot to reveal a tower of stuffed grape leaves, topped with broth-infused tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Rewarm gently in a covered pot over low heat with a little water to prevent burning.</p>
