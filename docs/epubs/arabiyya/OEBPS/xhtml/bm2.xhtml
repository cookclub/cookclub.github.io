			<p class="bmh1">AL’ARD</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Al’Ard supports Palestinian farmers to find a market and a fair price. In addition to excellent extra-virgin olive oil, Al’Ard has grown to be a premium supplier of Palestinian-made products such as za’atar, freekeh, and tahini, all available in the online store. <br/><a href="http://www.alardproducts.com">www.alardproducts.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">BURLAP &amp; BARREL</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Burlap &amp; Barrel is a single-origin spice company that partners directly with small farmers worldwide to provide the most equitably sourced and visually striking spices available to home cooks and professional chefs alike. You can find the spices on the Burlap &amp; Barrel website; it’s easy to get hooked on the selection. The company sources a significant number of spices from the Arab world and have many of the things you’ll need in this book. <br/><a href="http://www.burlapandbarrel.com">www.burlapandbarrel.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">CANAAN</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Canaan is a network of thousands of artisan farms across Palestine with a mission to preserve generations of Palestinian foodways and the vibrant ecosystem of farming essential to Palestinian culture. Canaan products include olive oil, spices, grains, and fun tapenades. You can purchase directly on the website or find the products in select grocery stores in the United States. <br/><a href="http://www.canaanusa.com">www.canaanusa.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">CORTAS</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Cortas is a Lebanese company that specializes in canned and bottled specialty goods, including but not limited to beans, pickles, essences, and preserves. This company is my go-to for rose and orange blossom water, pomegranate molasses, and fruit jams that are not as readily available in the United States, like quince jam. They also make ful madammas and tahini. Find the products at specialty and Arab grocers or purchase them online. <br/><a href="http://www.cortasfood.com">www.cortasfood.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">CORTO OLIVE OIL</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Corto is a family-owned olive orchard in Lodi, California. What sets them apart is their harvest, which I joined for a day during a brief window in October.<br/><a href="http://www.corto-olive.com">www.corto-olive.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">DIASPORA CO.</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">This spice company is hands down the best place to get your turmeric, in addition to a whole array of single-origin spices directly from small farmers in India leading the way in regenerative agriculture. Founded by third-generation Mumbai native Sana Javeri Kadri, this fierce woman-led business is on a mission to decolonize the spice trade. You can purchase directly from the website. <br/><a href="http://www.diasporaco.com">www.diasporaco.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">JUST DATE SYRUP</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Just Date Syrup is a doctor- and women-led company in the Bay Area demystifying sugar and inspiring a future generation to live our healthiest lives while enjoying the natural sweetness of Mother Earth. This date syrup is a staple in my pantry, and I love swirling it into tahini to make a sweet dipping sauce for my bread. The company also added pomegranate molasses to its repertoire. <br/><a href="http://www.justdatesyrup.com">www.justdatesyrup.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">KAROUN DAIRIES</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Karoun is located in San Fernando, California, and makes the specialty cheese and other dairy products that are essential to Eastern Mediterranean and Latin American cuisine. I rely on them for cheese that is hard to find, like Akkawi and Armenian string cheese (my favorite!). The company has an online platform that allows you to plug in your location to find the nearest source. <br/><a href="http://www.karouncheese.com/index/where-to-buy">www.karouncheese.com/index/where-to-buy</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">KRONOS</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">After trying a lot of phyllo dough, I found that this brand makes the most consistent crispy golden baklava. This product used to be called Sinbad, so searching either name on your online engine will get you the ordering forms you need. You can buy it in bulk as it keeps in the freezer for many months.</p>
			<p class="bmh1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_287" role="doc-pagebreak" title="287"/>OHANYAN’S</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Ohanyan’s is a family-run business in Fresno, California, specializing in specialty cured meats such as sujuk (a cured spiced sausage, similar to chorizo) and basturma (a cured, thinly sliced meat, similar to prosciutto). They are available at many Armenian and Arab grocery stores but can also be found online through a variety of Eastern Mediterranean marketplaces. <br/><a href="http://www.ohanyans.com">www.ohanyans.com</a></p>
			<p class="bmh1">TARAZI</p>
			<p class="bmpfno">Today, more and more delicious small-batch artisanal tahini brands are making it to store shelves, but my go-to, for its consistent nutty taste and stir-ability, is a bigger brand called Tarazi. It’s available at many Arab grocery stores and even some mainstream grocery store aisles. But you can also purchase it online. <br/><a href="http://www.tarazifoods.com">www.tarazifoods.com</a></p>
