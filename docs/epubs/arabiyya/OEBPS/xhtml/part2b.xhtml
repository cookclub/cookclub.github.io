			<p class="h1" id="page_57a">THE BASICS OF BREAD MAKING</p>
			<p class="pf">My earliest memory of bread was not the Arab bread of my mother and father’s childhoods but rather of a yeasty sweetness wafting out of the smokestacks from the Wonder Bread factory we used to pass driving from our home in Sudbury, Massachusetts, to the Natick Mall. Even before I understood how to read street signs or recognize landmarks, I’d catch a whiff—something between malty caramel and toasty almonds—and my nose would tell me our location on the route. Although I now prefer the aromas and flavors of bread that hasn’t been pumped with commercial yeast to speed up its fermentation, the smell of toasting Wonder Bread still fills me with indescribable joy.</p>
			<p class="p">When I teach Arab bread-baking workshops, I ask people what they love about bread, and nearly always, they say it’s the smell and the memories that smell elicits; that smell connects them to their culture and warms them with nostalgia for their childhoods. As bread meets your senses—smell, touch, sight, and, of course, taste—it pushes everything else away, leaving no room for other problems.</p>
			<p class="p">When I entered culinary school and got serious about baking professionally, I was eager to learn the secrets to making great bread. I read every fermentation book I could get my hands on and enrolled in countless classes, but the language and approach felt intimidating and inaccessible. I couldn’t relate to the overwhelmingly white male voices and overuse of Eurocentric terminology coming through the pages of recipes and tutorials. I would often think to myself, “When should I use the word <span class="i">levain</span>? Is it really any different from using the word <span class="i">starter</span>? What is <span class="i">biga</span>, then, and am I pronouncing that right?” It turns out they’re all stages and procedures in the process of making sourdough starter.</p>
			<p class="p">Bread baking, it seemed, was the domain of white male bakers and chefs. I couldn’t imagine myself thriving in this space or finding a mentor with whom I could feel excited, instead of feeling inadequate as I learned these concepts. That feeling of alienation was strong enough to keep me away from bread baking for years, focusing instead on sweet pastries.</p>
			<p class="p">But bread kept drawing me back. I was fascinated—and at times obsessed—with the alchemy of bread: just wheat, water, and salt, aided by hardworking yeast, that transform as if by magic into this life-sustaining food. Outside of the classroom, I studied the foundations of Arab baking by talking to elders, watching YouTube videos, and reading books in the library, discovering the sophisticated techniques and novel ingredients employed by Arabs over centuries.</p>
			<p class="p">Capturing “wild yeast” from the air to build sourdough bread starters was commonplace in villages spanning the Fertile Crescent, from Egypt <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58" role="doc-pagebreak" title="58"/>to Lebanon. Each generation passed along its knowledge about the care and feeding of the living organisms fermenting their foods. Their wisdom was not confined to experts but was instead cultivated in homes from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, and grandparents to grandchildren, since the act of baking bread was a family affair.</p>
			<p class="p">While I’m put off by the jargon of bread baking, it does bring out my inner nerd. I get as much joy from the science as from the connection to generations before me who used the same techniques I now use. Even today, after thousands of loaves, I get a little rush of excitement with each new batch of dough, watching, feeling, smelling its distinct features as it takes shape in my hands.</p>
			<p class="p">I’ve broken this section into savory and sweet breads and pastries. It is a mix of the best of both worlds: breads that inspired me during my visits to the Arab world, along with breads I’ve developed as a professional baker.</p>
			<p class="p">Khobz Arabi (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_71">this page</a>), or Arab bread, a 6- to 8-inch flatbread (depending on your desired thickness), is foundational to the cuisine of our region. This dough is used as a base for many recipes throughout the book, so I encourage you to learn and practice making it. There are two approaches to making it, and I offer both: a yeasted base dough as well as a sourdough base dough. You can use either. The sourdough entails more labor and commitment, such as building and maintaining your own starter, but it also leaves you with more flavor. Try both of them and see what works best for you. If you are strapped for time and still want to have a try at sourdough, many local bakeries freely offer their starters to give you a leg up.</p>
			<p class="p">Most of my bread recipes involve a stand mixer with a dough hook for ease and consistency, but if you are new to bread, I suggest starting by using your hands to get a feel for the construction of dough. You might even notice some buff contours in your forearms after a bit of practice! Ultimately, building gluten structure in naturally fermented sourdough requires heavy-duty mixing, so if you’d like a steady supply of fresh homemade bread, a KitchenAid mixer makes a good investment.</p>
			<p class="p">Below are a few key concepts in bread making that will help you understand the bread recipes in this book. If you have a question, chances are there are more details here that you can refer to for your bread-making process. Come back to this section as often as you would like or take a crash course now in order to approach the recipes in this section with more ease.</p>
			<p class="h2">Measuring</p>
			<p class="pf">I have included both weight and volume measurements in my baking recipes. While you may be more accustomed to using measuring cups and spoons, measuring weight on a scale will give you much greater accuracy, leading to more consistent results. Once you bake a perfect loaf, you’ll be able to replicate your dough using weights, and it’s easy to make tweaks by tracking small adjustments; that’s hard to do with volume measures. In bread baking, even slight variations can cause slight changes in the product.</p>
			<p class="p">You can never scoop flour exactly the same way twice, so precision becomes important. Plus, weighing actually produces fewer dishes to wash later. Once your bowl is on the scale, you can pour each ingredient directly in and skip the measuring tools. For less than $20, you can pick up a small kitchen scale online or at most homeware stores. If measuring by volume is your only option, no matter; the smell of freshly baking bread will delight your senses every time. Just take care not to pack down the flour: scoop a heaping cup and scrape away the excess with your finger or a butter knife.</p>
			<div class="bxboxO">
				<p class="bxt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59" role="doc-pagebreak" title="59"/>USING RATIOS</p>
				<p class="bx">To scale the recipes up or down, I use ratios. This allows me to make ten pitas for a family breakfast or fifty for a special occasion, simply by recalculating the percentage. The formula for bread ratio pegs water, salt, and oil against the measurement of flour. The flour always represents 100 percent. If I am using 1 pound of flour, then a pound of flour is 100 percent. From there, 50 percent hydration means the recipe needs 8 ounces of water, 3 percent salt means 0.5 ounce of salt (0.03 multiplied by 16 ounces), and so on and so forth.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h2" id="page_59a">Kneading</p>
			<p class="pf">Kneading the dough is the process by which you create the gluten structure that will tighten and eventually loosen enough to hold tiny pockets of gas; it’s the inflation that differentiates puffy chewy bread from crunchy crumbly crackers. Kneading usually involves mixing wet and dry ingredients with a spoon or your hands until they merge into a shaggy goo and then turning the mass onto a lightly floured work surface. As you knead the dough, its texture begins to firm.</p>
			<div class="float_right_wide">
				<img alt="" class="image" src="../images/7.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="p">To knead by hand, grip the bottom edge of the dough farthest from you, curl it upward to the center of the dough mass, then push the dough away with your palm. Rotate the ball one-quarter turn and grab the bottom farthest away from you again, curl it up toward the center, and push it away with your palm. Continue the pattern: pull up, push away, rotate. For simplicity’s sake, I refer to this as pull-push-turn. Keep some flour nearby, dusting the ball with small pinches to keep it from sticking to you or the board. You may be tempted to throw on lots of extra flour if the dough is sticky. Don’t. A slightly sticky dough grabs onto your work surface, and the resistance it creates actually functions as a second kneading tool. Allow the dough to stick to your hands for a bit. Eventually, you can rub them together with a sprinkle of flour and roll the bits back into your dough. With every turn, the dough becomes a bit smoother. This process takes about 5 minutes or up to 10 minutes for dough with more water content (wetter doughs take longer to stiffen up).</p>
			<p class="p">For some recipes, such as for my pita, you need to let the flour and water mixture sit for 15 to 20 minutes before kneading, a technique called autolyse. This allows the molecules to internally reconfigure to develop the dough structure themselves, giving you a head start on your kneading and making the process easier. My rule of thumb is: get the best structure you can while messing with the dough as little as possible. Dough that’s over-kneaded becomes tough and chewy, but this is more of a concern when you’re using a stand mixer. It is nearly impossible to overknead dough by hand. You will tire out before that happens.</p>
			<p class="h2">The First “Rise”</p>
			<p class="pf">When bread dough rises, yeast is its main actor. Yeast is a living organism, technically a fungus, which needs food, warmth, and moisture to survive, much like us. There are two main types of yeast, and my breads use both: commercial and natural. I’ll go into detail on natural yeast later (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_63">this page</a>), but the most commonly used commercial yeast in home recipes—and the ones in this book—is active dry yeast. Most recipes require you to “bloom” the yeast with water and sugar, hydrating it back to life as it foams up.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60" role="doc-pagebreak" title="60"/>The rising caused by yeast is the process of fermentation. The yeast, once it comes into contact with flour and water, consumes starches within the flour, breaking them down into amino acids, natural sugars, and free fatty acids and producing alcohol and gases as by-products, which give yeasted bread its characteristic flavor and air pockets.</p>
			<p class="p">The longer the process, the more time for the molecules to build flavor and aroma. As time goes by, the dough gets more acidic because the alcohol turns to something like vinegar, just as it does for wine. The right balance of time and temperature in the rise creates just enough acidity to build flavor. Too little activity doesn’t produce enough flavor, but too much activity overconsumes the sugars and breaks down the molecules of your new gluten structure, limiting the yeast’s activity and collapsing the dough. To avoid this pitfall, many bakers ferment in the cold, where bacteria still thrive but yeast slows their activity; both can do their thing, nice and slow.</p>
			<p class="p">I’m a big fan of cold fermentation, or in baker’s speak, “retarding” the dough in the refrigerator. It not only builds flavor but also creates stronger dough because the extended yeast activity allows more of the natural gluten formation. Every burst of gas sets protein molecules in motion, spawning more opportunities to link up and form new chains of gluten. A cold rise can be convenient, since it doesn’t require a watchful two-hour wait for the dough to rise. You can make dough in the morning to bake in the evening or let the dough rise overnight to make fresh bread in the morning by refrigerating it during the rise. The natural process in my sourdough base recipe requires slow fermentation.</p>
			<div class="bxboxR">
				<p class="bxt">ADJUSTING YEAST QUANTITIES</p>
				<p class="bx">The recipes in this book call for active dry yeast. There’s another kind of yeast called instant dry yeast, which is finer and dissolves more quickly, so you can add it directly to your dry ingredients without having to dissolve it first. If you only have instant yeast on hand, decrease the amount of yeast by about 20 percent. For example, 1 teaspoon of instant dry yeast is equivalent to 1¼ teaspoons of active dry yeast.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bxboxP">
				<p class="bxt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61" role="doc-pagebreak" title="61"/>IS YOUR DOUGH READY? A THREE-STEP TEST</p>
				<p class="bx">Groups of proteins bind and break to create bread’s skeletal structure. Deriving from the Latin word for “to stick,” gluten describes the proteins that form when flour meets water, generating an intricate web of protein chains that provide flexibility and structure to hold air pockets for leavened bread. The act of kneading binds the proteins into strong elastic chains, producing bread with a perfect crumb (a baking term meaning a well-distributed gluten network producing plenty of holes in the interior texture of the bread) and a flexible, satisfying tug between your teeth.</p>
				<p class="bx">Each variety of wheat produces its own gluten structure; this means different flours yield different results. I use a combination of bread flour, which provides a stronger gluten structure to hold larger air pockets, and a little bit of all-purpose flour to counteract the strength of the bread flour and to create a more delicate chew. For my sourdough starters, I add rye flour for its super-ability to attract more wild yeasts than other flours do. The more yeasts, the more flavor.</p>
				<p class="bx">There are three ways to tell when your dough’s gluten structure is just where you want it and when to stop kneading: texture, elasticity, and strength.</p>

					</li>
					<li class="bxnl">
						<p class="bxnl">Elasticity: The dough springs back when you dimple it with your fingers.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxnl">

					</li>
				</ol>

			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62" role="doc-pagebreak" title="62"/>Shaping, Rounding, and (Sometimes) Proofing</p>
			<p class="pf">The bread recipes in this chapter involve shaping dough in different ways, most often into a ball. When your dough has risen, you want to turn it out of its bowl and cut it into the desired number of pieces while taking care to expel as little air as possible. Making rounds is like creating a dough balloon. You’re pulling the dough’s surface taut around the inner pockets of air. To do this, gently tug the dough from the top surface and tuck it beneath the ball to create a smooth top for your round. Tighten this shape by placing the round on an unfloured work surface, cupping your hands around the dough and shifting the ball in small circular motions, all while keeping it in contact with the work surface. The dough creates its own resistance, sticking to your work surface, helping to tighten the molecules and forming a seam on the bottom. With practice, you may be able to roll two balls at a time by cupping a ball of dough beneath each hand and using your thumbs to pull and tuck the surface beneath your round.</p>
			<p class="p">Many of my recipes require only a short period of rest before rolling out and baking, but some, such as Ka’ak (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_85">this page</a>), call for shaping and then proofing your bread. Proofing means to let it rise again in its final intended shape. You want to bake your bread at the point it contains the maximum air and while the dough still has the strength to contain it. I give suggestions for proofing times in each recipe, but the best way to tell if your dough is fully proofed is by dimpling the surface with your finger. <span class="i">Underproofed dough springs back; overproofed dough deflates. Just-right dough holds its dimple.</span> By this time, you will have noticed a considerable growth in the size of your dough.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h2">Baking</p>
			<p class="pf">Many of my bread recipes require intense high heat, which is not a simple feat in a home oven. The search for a scorching hearth is the very reason people carry their dough to the bakers who expertly tend communal ovens in the Arab world. Nevertheless, over time, I’ve discovered some tricks to re-create the experience of a bakery in your home kitchen. Breads in this book are baked in two ways: in the oven or over a high-heat griddle. The griddle mimics the convex griddle traditionally used to cook flatbreads, which go by the name of the surface on which they’re cooked—saj breads. For oven breads, make sure to preheat well before baking. If you want to reproduce the effect of a clay oven, invest in a baking stone (see Pizza Tools, <a href="part1b.xhtml#page_19a">this page</a>) to warm on a low rack, for at least an hour, in advance. The initial boost of heat proofs the bread one final time in the oven, maximizing the color and crust without drying it out.</p>
			<p class="p">One sign of good fermentation is the golden hue of a bread’s crust. This is called the Maillard reaction, which is achieved by driving away moisture with heat, kicking off a chain of reactions that result in the caramelization of sugars on the bread’s surface. Applying the right heat for the right time is critical for keeping the bread moist inside and beautifully crusted outside.</p>
			<p class="p">A few of my recipes, like Ka’ak (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_85">this page</a>), require a steam effect to develop a sweet crust on the outside and a fully baked moist bread on the inside, but most bake in high heat for a short time.</p>

				<p class="sbt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63" role="doc-pagebreak" title="63"/>To Sourdough or Not to Sourdough?</p>
				<p class="sb">One thing that makes the breads in my restaurant unique is they are made with “starter”—a fermented dough with natural yeast that allows for a slow rise. We spent three years building the starter, beginning with a small cup of starter brought over by a friend from Tartine Bakery. I debated whether to rely on natural fermentation to make thousands of rounds of dough a week. The wild yeasts can be tricky, and we struggled to scale up and manage inconsistencies in the beginning. But the wild yeast and bacteria create far more complex flavors than commercial yeast can do alone, so that is why I use both wild and commercial yeasts in my breads. At a certain point in 2019, we found our sweet—or shall I say sour—spot, creating a flatbread with delicious complexity that made it as interesting as the meats, cheeses, yogurts, and vegetables we serve on and with it.</p>
				<p class="sb">I will never forget the day one of my regulars, a prominent Lebanese academic with strong opinions on Arab culture and politics, arrived for his dose of mana’eesh. He told me firsthand my bread was even better than the loaves made in Beirut. “It’s like how it used to be made,” he said emphatically. “Unfortunately, unless you go out to the villages, they don’t make it like that anymore.” I could think of no bigger compliment, and his praise solidified my commitment to learning about fermentation and continuing to perfect our bread at Reem’s.</p>
				<p class="sb">My obsession with natural fermentation is probably no coincidence; it’s an ancient tradition dating back to the region of my ancestors, thousands of years before the invention of commercial yeast. In ancient Egypt, the creation of natural starter evolved from beer making. Breweries and bakeries often co-located and, not surprisingly, were run by women. Like many of the best inventions, the discovery was probably accidental. Most likely, the wild yeast spores spawned by beer brewing went to work on the flour and water which were mixed in the same clay pots for bread baking, and generated the same amino acids, alcohol, and gases that we now craft with great care to produce soft, chewy, heaven-scented bread. This discovery, several millennia later, connects me to bread as part of my own lifeline.</p>
				<p class="sb">Way back before I started my bakery and before sourdough starter became popular for home bakers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, my only exposure to sourdough was at the iconic Boudin Bakery, located on Pier 39 in San Francisco. Though delicious as bread bowls with chowder, the loaves themselves didn’t appeal to me at the time—I preferred the malty sweetness of quick-rise breads and disliked the sour element. When I joined the Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria, a sister to the famous Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley, California, in 2011, I knew I’d have my hands in lots of sourdough. Tending the live cultures and tasting the breads we produced, my taste shifted away from Wonder Bread and toward the nuanced world of sourdough and the endless range of flavors it introduces. My appreciation for fermentation took some time, not unlike the process itself.</p>
