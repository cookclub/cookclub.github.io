			<p class="ry">Makes 1 cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">NUTTY, TART, HERBACEOUS</span> za’atar is a beloved spice mix of my childhood. No Arab household from the Levant is complete without it. Activated by heat, za’atar in olive oil emits an irresistible savory scent. When I was building my bakery, I joked about creating a fan system to blow the za’atar scent into the street to lure people in, just as with Mrs. Field’s Cookies. That ploy turned out to be unnecessary, however, since curiosity quickly turns to delight after people taste za’atar for the first time. I’m often asked if the taste can be bottled up to take home. Luckily, since this is a spice mix, it can!</p>
			<p class="rhn">Za’atar is the ultimate superfood of Greater Syria, or Bilad al Sham. It has antiseptic qualities, helping to strengthen immunity and prevent foodborne illnesses, and it contains iron, supporting bone strength and blood circulation. Many Arabs I know say their mothers used to feed them za’atar before a big test to improve memory; enthusiasts insist the medical research backs them up. It doesn’t take a scientist to affirm that the power of this flavor combo lights up the frontal lobe and leaves happy bellies in its wake.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Many breakfasts start with a small plate, filled half with za’atar and half with good-quality olive oil. Eaten the Arab way, we dip our bread into the oil to create an adhesive and then dip it into the spice mix. The combo of grassy, fruity oil with the complex flavors in this spice mix make it comforting and craveable enough to eat daily over a lifetime. Mix yours with olive oil or sprinkle on meat, salad, or anything else your heart desires.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Za’atar refers both to the spice mix and the plant that is the main ingredient, which translates to Syrian oregano or hyssop and can be found in specialty stores. If you cannot find it, you can substitute dried oregano or marjoram (or a combination of the two!).</p>
			<p class="rilf">¼ cup dried hyssop or Syrian oregano</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a spice grinder or blender, pulse the hyssop to a fine powder. Sift to remove any stems. Mix with the sumac, salt, and sesame seeds.</p>
			<p class="rp">Za’atar can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.</p>
			<div class="sbbox">
				<p class="sbt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25" role="doc-pagebreak" title="25"/>Terroir and Territory</p>
				<p class="sb">Like any plant, za’atar takes on the flavor of the soil in which it is grown, so no two za’atar plants taste exactly the same. Resilient, drought-resistant za’atar takes root even on the most arid hilltops and between rocks, not unlike our people. In an unwinnable bid for control, Israel, using the pretense of conservation, now prohibits foraging za’atar in the wild.</p>
				<p class="sb">Outlawed za’atar grows all over the world in the greenhouses, farms, and backyards of diasporic Arabs, who have smuggled the precious seeds from their visits home. In Palestine and Lebanon, entrepreneurs in the slow food movement are helping small farmers scale their za’atar production and sell directly to consumers. I dream of saving the best seeds to set up a za’atar farm one day in California, where I could demonstrate our symbolic rootedness, creating home and connection to the land in our adopted countries.</p>
				<p class="sb">Don’t get discouraged in your search for this elusive plant. If you ask a grocer in Palestine for za’atar, you might get thyme, while in Jordan or Lebanon, you might get a variety of oregano, hyssop, or marjoram. The plants produce a similar earthy profile, and recipes often use them interchangeably.</p>
				<p class="sb">Try out whatever varietals you’re able to find and adjust the proportions and combinations to suit your taste. I like mine on the earthier side and go easy on the sumac. Too much of the sour berry can cause heartburn. As herbs in the Arab World become harder to access, some manufacturers add wheat to stretch their mix: a vibrant green mix indicates the purity of the herbs; a dull, dusty color means it’s been diluted. Most importantly, have fun testing and tasting until you have a mix that makes your heart sing.</p>

			<p class="rt">Seven-Spice Mix</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes ¼ cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THE MIXTURE IN</span> baharat, which literally means “spices” in Arabic, varies from region to region and family to family in the Arab world. In the Levant, baharat is most commonly prepared as a seven-spice mix that relies on warming spices tempered by woody flavors like cumin and coriander. The spice is so foundational to stews, meats, and rice dishes that, while every family has its own recipe, it seldom needs to be written down. If you equip yourself with only one spice mix to make the recipes in this book, this would be it. I use this spice mix as a base for much of my cooking and layer on other spices as needed.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled and stays fresh for a month when stored in an airtight container. If you multiply the recipe, it’s better to toast the spices one at a time to ensure each has sufficient access to the surface of the pan.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • If you don’t have all the spices in your pantry to make the seven-spice mix, you can omit the cloves and cardamom to make a five-spice mix for recipes that call for seven-spice.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 tablespoon whole allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">9 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">1-inch piece cinnamon stick</p>
			<p class="ril">½ tablespoon whole cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">½-inch piece nutmeg, crushed</p>
			<p class="rpf">Combine all of the spices in a small pan and toast over medium heat until warm and fragrant. The spices should start to gain the slightest color, have a noticeable fragrance, and begin to make a faint crackling sound. I gently touch the spices with the palm of my hand. They should be hot but not burn you. Do not let them smoke. If that happens, you’ve gone too far, and you’ll need to toss them and start fresh. The whole process should take 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">The spices can go straight from the pan to the bowl of a spice grinder, but be sure to allow a minute or two for them to cool, uncovered, before grinding to avoid condensation. Then pulse in a grinder or high-powered blender until coarsely ground. A coffee grinder works well, too. Just make sure to wipe or run a spoonful of rice through it afterward to clean the cup.</p>

			<p class="rt">Chile-Spice Mix</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes ⅔ cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS CHILE MIX</span> packs a perfect balance of earthy, sour, and salty flavors with just enough heat from the sweet Aleppo pepper to let you know you’re alive but keep you from losing the other flavors. It’s equally at home as a rub for the grill, a garnish for mezze spreads, or a seasoning for roasted vegetables and sauces.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe could easily be doubled or tripled and stay good for about a month in a dry, tightly sealed container. A larger batch can be stored in the freezer in a tightly sealed container indefinitely. It’s great to keep on hand for those nights when you need a quick dinner. Rubbed on ground meat or vegetables with a little olive oil, it can go from fridge to grill to table in about 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • If you can’t find dried lime, sumac makes an excellent substitute.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons whole cardamom seeds (about 17 pods)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons whole cumin seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">6 tablespoons Aleppo pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons dried lime, ground</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="rpf">Toast the coriander, cardamom, and cumin in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. The spices will begin to dance around in the pan when they are close to being done. Be careful not to let them burn. Once they are slightly darker in color and fragrant, remove them from the pan and let cool completely. Then grind them to a coarse powder in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Mix with the Aleppo pepper, salt, dried lime, and cinnamon.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes about 3 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">ARAB HOSPITALITY HAS</span> its own rhythm, but essential to a beautifully orchestrated experience are roasted nuts. My nut mix marries my love of sweets with salty, savory, and spicy flavors, as well as an array of shapes and sizes. In Arab homes, we snack on nuts before, after, and between meals.</p>
			<p class="rhn">There’s a special art to scooping up favorites while artfully disguising the selection process so it doesn’t look like less desirable nuts are being left for others. I’ve combined almonds, walnuts, and pistachios here, but I often use pumpkin seeds or cashews as well. Blanching the nuts softens them so they absorb the sugar as they toast and cool into a crunchy shell.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I use Syrian Aleppo pepper in this and many of my spice mixes. It’s been harder to find in the years since Syria has been at war; Marrakesh pepper from Turkey makes a good substitute.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This nut mix is great to make ahead when you are hosting and tastes even better the next day.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing the tray</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ teaspoons Aleppo pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">1¼ teaspoons ground coriander</p>
			<p class="ril">1¼ teaspoons ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">3 cups mixed nuts and seeds (walnuts, pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, pumpkin seeds, or cashews)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Grease a 13 by 18-inch sheet tray with olive oil.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fill a 3-quart pot two-thirds full of water and bring to a boil. While the water comes to a boil, mix the sugar, Aleppo pepper, coriander, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the water is boiling, ease the nuts into the water to avoid getting splashed. Soften the nuts in the boiling water for 2 minutes, skimming away any foam, and drain well in a fine-mesh strainer.</p>
			<p class="rp">Toss the nuts into the bowl with the spice mix. Stir to coat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spread the mixture evenly on the prepared tray, separating the nuts so they have room to dry and crisp. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, using a spatula to mix the nuts every 5 minutes or so, until they give off a toasty smell.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cool thoroughly before serving.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29" role="doc-pagebreak" title="29"/>The mix can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</p>

			<p class="rt">Cocoa Nib and Nut Spice Mix</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 1 cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">ORIGINALLY EGYPTIAN, DUKKAH</span> in Arabic means “to pound.” Dukkah means different things to different people, but most mixes include cumin, coriander, salt, sesame, and a nut or grain. I’ve added cocoa nibs for an utterly original bittersweet flavor combo. Cocoa originated in Mexico and somehow skipped the Arab world along its trade route. The combination of our smoky flavors and the chocolate bean fragments is my own blend of these two flavor origins.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The textures and flavors in this mix go beautifully on fish, meat, or vegetables, folded into labneh, spread on bread in an olive oil paste, or sprinkled on soups and stews.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Technique is especially important here. Roasting each spice and nut individually allows you to smell for doneness. Grinding each ingredient individually ensures a uniform texture to the mix and prevents it from forming a paste. Remove the spices from the heat as soon as each becomes fragrant. Cool each ingredient completely before grinding to avoid trapping heat, which causes sogginess. Texture is a matter of taste. I like my textures finer, so the tastes blend together. Many prefer them coarser, with a crunchier texture.</p>
			<p class="rilf">½ cup whole almonds, with or without skins</p>
			<p class="ril">1⅛ teaspoons coriander seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">1⅛ teaspoons cumin seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon black peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons sesame seeds</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons cocoa nibs or unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rpf">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the almonds on a sheet tray. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, until they smell toasty and have taken on a light golden-brown color.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the almonds are roasting, heat a dry shallow pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Toast the coriander, cumin, and peppercorns, one at a time, for 2 to 3 minutes each or until they are fragrant and begin to make a crackling sound.</p>
			<p class="rp">Set aside each spice to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the same pan, toast the pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds separately, until they begin to sound as though they are popping or crackling, 3 to 5 minutes. Set everything aside to cool completely before processing.</p>
			<p class="rp">When completely cooled, pulse the coriander, cumin, and peppercorns to a fine powder in a food processor or blender. Empty into a small bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pulse the pumpkin seeds to a medium grind, the texture of coarsely ground pepper, and add to the bowl. Do the same with the cocoa nibs and almonds, being sure to do this in small batches. The high oil content of the ingredients requires small batches to prevent clumping.</p>
			<p class="rp">Leave the toasted sesame seeds whole and stir into the mixture along with the salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">The mix can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 months.</p>
