			<p class="pt">Arab Table</p>
			<p class="cepi">By the time I reached my teens, a typical weeknight meal featured a hodgepodge of dishes passed back and forth across our table: spiced rice and vermicelli with stewed green bean loubieh leftovers, perhaps supplemented by last-minute vegetable chow mein Chinese takeout (halal to please my father) and General Tso’s chicken in sweet spicy sauce (to please us kids).</p>
			<p class="pf">My mother, a grad student, would rush in from a forty-five-minute commute and then whip together dinner to head off the pending state-of-hangry threatening her home. The nightly news, turned up a little too loud, would sedate my dad in the next room, where he dozed after work. I would be pacing my room, guessing at my physics assignments to avert my father’s offers of help (he always took too long). And my sister Dalyah would hang out with her best friend, Elissa, the unofficial fourth Assil sister. My baby sister, Manal, would cling to our mother’s side, still acclimating to after-school care. It took a small miracle to get us all to the table.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" role="doc-pagebreak" title="133"/>The Arab table, for me, begins with my mother, Iman Kishawi. Today, she is a scientist with a PhD and a twenty-year career working on the human genome project, proving it’s never too late to return to your passion.</p>
			<p class="p">But it wasn’t always that way. After a brief courtship, my parents married and made a hurried exit from Beirut, where civil war raged on the streets outside, and came to America, where my father landed his first engineering job. My mother jokes that if someone had arrived at her doorstep offering to move her to the North Pole, she would have gone immediately.</p>
			<p class="p">Instead, she landed in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where she discovered the ultimate American delicacy, peanut butter and jelly, to the detriment of her waistline. She consumed these confections along with her first introduction to American culture: the daytime soap opera <span class="i">General Hospital</span> and its incredulous adventures of Luke and Laura, who died and came back to life, reuniting in their love for one another several times. In place of bombs, F-16 fighter jets, and the hum of urban life, horse-drawn buggies pulled Amish families from farm to town. To say she felt shell-shocked would be too ironic.</p>
			<p class="p">Where my grandmother was extravagant, sliding plates over one another until the table overflowed with vegetables, preserves, pickles, cheeses, and spreads, my mother was ultra-practical, packing vegetables, grains, and meat into masterful one-pot meals.</p>
			<p class="p">Nutrition and flavor ruled my mother’s kitchen; impressing guests was lower on her list. She knew how to layer spices and aromatics into stews like Shorbat Freekeh (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_168">this page</a>), a rich smoky concoction of cracked green wheat, that even to this day, tastes like home each time I take my first bite.</p>
			<p class="p">When we moved to Sudbury, a small suburb of Boston, our table expanded to feed more than just my mother and father. The Arab table became a calling for her to nourish those she loved. If we came home asking why we weren’t doing taco Tuesday like the rest of the kids, my mother would sauté some ground meat in tomato sauce, spiked with Arab seven-spice mix, spoon it into tortillas, and voilà, it became Arab taco night. She kept her pantry stocked to feed family members who were passing through, whether on their way to begin university studies or nursing heartbreak.</p>
			<p class="p">After playing this role for half a decade, my mother decided she had been at home long enough. She overcame my father’s reluctance, convincing him that our family needed two incomes. She wanted to be a scientist and set about resuming her studies at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. As part of her PhD program, my mother took a research job at the laboratories of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Every day, no matter what else might have been happening, she would dash out the door to feed her lab cells. We joked that she cared more about her cells than her kids.</p>
			<p class="p">With my mother’s daily departure, we became latchkey kids, raised on afternoon TV, including <span class="i">Saved by the Bell</span> and <span class="i">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</span>. The cupboards soon filled with instant ramen, mac and cheese, and giant square pizzas from Sam’s Club. Dinner became a grab-and-go affair, and we rarely ate at the same time. For us, the comforts and tradition of the Arab table were overcome by the demands of working parenthood in America.</p>
			<p class="p">I missed the years when our home was a bed and breakfast for uncles and cousins who filled our table with Arabic and laughter. I began to long for the times when our aunts lavished us with family meals on our trips to Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine. There, no matter the hardships, the family gathered each day: men returned from work, food flooded the table, and everyone sat together at mealtime. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134" role="doc-pagebreak" title="134"/>Despite the economic and political instability all around them, there was a sense of connectedness at those tables that I loved.</p>
			<p class="p">In America, we had stability but no table. The Arabic phrase we use to call family to the table for the first meal of the day, <span class="i">khalleena nitrawwa’,</span> means “let’s relax.” Here, we’d shake cereal from a box and dash out the door to school. There was no tirwaa’a (in other words, no leisurely breakfast), no fetching fresh falafel from the street corner to add to the mosaic of small plates, stacked with fruits and vegetables and spread with olive oil–coated labneh and cheeses.</p>
			<p class="p">My mother, too, struggled with these contradictions. She had arrived in this country with a master’s degree in microbiology, only to take up a post in the kitchen, when, in fact, she did not even know how to cook. She deferred her professional ambitions for eight years to fulfill family and social expectations as a wife and mother. It was nearly impossible to do everything well all the time, and yet our freezer full of fatayer proved her determination to try.</p>
			<p class="p">While she had less time for meals, she still remained vigilant against blows that scraped away at our identities. Protecting us from the hardships of being Arab in America sometimes meant taking matters into her own hands. In middle school, two older boys often waited at the end of the block, ready to pepper me with insults and threats on my daily walk to school. I’d bow my head and pick up my pace, until I felt safe enough to catch my breath. One day, one of the boys taunted me, “Go back to Arabic.” I answered in the same nonsense way, “Go back to Italian.” That day, I had come home crying one time too many, and my mother marched down the street to confront one of the boys. With a few choice words, issued at very close range, and a handful of his shirt in her grip, the bullying stopped. No one ever braved a second encounter with my mother.</p>
			<p class="p">One day, I returned home from school in tears. Our social studies unit on cultures of the world had screened a film from the 1970s about Arabs that depicted an Arab family around the dinner table. In place of the invocation <span class="i">yislamu idayk</span>—“God bless your hands”—murmured almost reflexively by everyone I knew to celebrate the cook, the film’s dramatic climax hinged on Arabs burping to show appreciation. As my classmates laughed, I felt shame and embarrassment.</p>
			<p class="p">The next day, my mother stormed the school and demanded that they establish an alternate lesson plan; however, there wasn’t an existing one that depicted Arabs as we really are. So, she made one herself and volunteered to teach it. At the end of the month of Ramadan, our month of fasting, she came to the school as a guest speaker and shared ma’amoul, our special nut- or date-stuffed cookies with a delicate melt-in-your-mouth semolina crust pressed into decorative molds. Every year thereafter, she found a way to arrive at school with sweets and teach a lesson about Arab culture.</p>
			<p class="p">Her ferocity wasn’t reserved just for our battles. She fought to be recognized even in everyday transactions. I cannot count the number of times she confronted store clerks who heard her accent and made the mistake of underestimating her. “Do you think I’m clueless just because I have an accent?” she would say, while disputing even small matters at the register. We’d try to play it down, embarrassed by her escalations. But in hindsight, I realize she was demonstrating what it means to stand up for yourself.</p>
			<p class="p">I get my courage from my mother. She’s not a diplomat; she’s an advocate. She wanted to protect us from forces that would cause us to question our worth. Education was our ticket to financial independence, and she made sure we had the best. Throughout my life, I have witnessed my mother <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" role="doc-pagebreak" title="135"/>stand by the side of women dealing with abusive husbands, fighting unsuccessful battles against cancer, and standing up to unfair conditions in their workplaces. But she struggled in her own household to get support from all of us to keep our house in order.</p>
			<p class="p">She wasn’t as religious as my father, but she felt constant pressure to enforce his strict rules, telling us we couldn’t go places or do things that she might have thought were okay. She had little time to herself, and when tensions erupted, she’d dash out of the house and escape alone to a theater to watch whatever happened to be on screen.</p>
			<p class="p">In my search for purpose, I have returned again and again to the Arab table as a place that shapes my identity.</p>
			<p class="p">The Arab table, for me, is a place of contradiction. The table I create in my adulthood resists patriarchy and concedes to a nurturing maternal impulse. It can feel good, generous, even spiritual to cook for others. And it can feel oppressive when it’s expected of me.</p>
			<p class="p">Ironically, when I finally found my way to the kitchen, I confronted an industry dominated by white men. Like my mother, I made it my mission to set my own terms. But it hasn’t been easy.</p>
			<p class="p">Still, I’m excited to raise a feminist child and to demonstrate that family, to me, is larger than just my household: it’s my co-workers, community, friends, and comrades, struggling just like me. I’ve stationed my Arab table at the crossroads of my many communities.</p>
