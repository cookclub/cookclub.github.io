			<p class="rt">Basic Sourdough Starter</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about 1 cup</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SOURDOUGH REQUIRES CARE,</span> attention, and lots of loving.</p>
			<p class="rhn">When I started as a worker-owner at Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria, I stepped into well-established protocols for rotating and feeding the starter. We learned to take into account the weather, water temperature, flour-to-water ratio, and the frequency of feedings. Some days, our starter did not “look right,” and we’d begin our detective work to find out why. How long had it been sitting? At what room temperature? Who fed it last? Did that person measure correctly? Once we’d tweaked the starter, we’d set it out to bask in the ambient room temperature to restore its gooey bubbly luster.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Building your own sour culture is simple and takes about 10 days. If fed correctly, it can last forever. Legend has it, some starters have been passed down as a nourishing heirloom over multiple generations. Reem’s starter uses local rye flour, adding a touch of California love to our Arab breads. Rye hosts wild airborne yeasts and adds an element of whole grain complexity to the dough.</p>
			<p class="rhn">There’s a life cycle for starters…they rise, crest, and then, left untended, they begin to decline (see the section on fermentation on <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_60">this page</a>). When a starter has gone too long and descended into a bubbly soup, save ¼ cup, toss out the rest (don’t think of it as waste but rather as energy expended), and begin feeding your starter again. In the bread world, that bit you save is called the mother, and I think of mine as a mother connecting me to my lineage.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 cup/130g white rye flour</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/360ml lukewarm water</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups/210g bread flour</p>
			<p class="rpf">DAY 1: In a medium bowl, stir the rye flour into ½ cup/120ml of the water, until the clumps dissolve. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and let it sit at room temperature for 48 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">DAY 3: Bubbles should begin to appear on the surface. Stir ¼ cup/35g of the bread flour into the mix until smooth. Put the mixture into a plastic container with high sides and cover it with a dish towel. Let it sit at room temperature for another 48 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">DAY 5: The starter should start to smell like sourdough bread and show large bubbles. Feed it another ¼ cup/35g of the bread flour and stir until fully incorporated and thick. The texture will be stiff and difficult to stir. Let it sit at room temperature for another 48 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">DAY 7: Remove ¼ cup of the starter into a new container with high sides and discard the rest. This becomes your “mother,” the starter you’ll use to jump-start your next batch of starter. Add another ½ cup/120ml of the water and another ½ cup/70g of the bread flour to your mother, scraping down the sides of the container and making sure everything is well incorporated. Let it sit at room temperature for another 48 hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">DAY 9: Remove another ¼ cup of the starter and discard the rest. Add the remaining ½ cup/120ml water and the remaining ½ cup/70g bread flour to your mother and let it sit at room temperature for another day. By this time, your starter should be visibly expanding.</p>
			<p class="rp">DAY 10: Your sourdough starter should reach its peak and be ready for the final feeding before use; see Basic Sourdough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_68">this page</a>).</p>
			<div class="bxboxP">
				<p class="bxt1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67" role="doc-pagebreak" title="67"/>FEEDING YOUR SOURDOUGH STARTER</p>
				<p class="bx">To maintain your starter, you should feed it on a regular basis. The following is my basic formula for maintaining a starter.</p>
				<p class="r1ilf">1 cup/140g bread flour</p>
				<p class="r1il">½ cup/65g white rye flour</p>
				<p class="r1il">½ cup/120ml water</p>
				<p class="r1il">1 tablespoon/15g Basic Sourdough Starter (opposite)</p>
				<p class="bxf">In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix with your hands. This will initially feel like a dry dough. (I like a less-hydrated starter, so I can detect more easily any rise or fall in its life cycle.) If the dough feels stiff, do not worry. It will come alive after 12 hours at room temperature, and your starter will then be ready to use.</p>
				<p class="bxt1f">STARTER CARE TIPS AND TRICKS</p>
				<p class="bx">The following are helpful tips to maintain a healthy sourdough starter.</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="bxnl">
						<p class="bxnl">To maintain your starter for frequent use…If you’re baking daily or even several times a week, keep your starter at room temperature and feed it daily, using the formula above to keep it bubbly.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxnl">
						<p class="bxnl">To maintain your starter for infrequent use…If you’re not baking weekly, keep your starter in the refrigerator. Once a week, pull it out of the refrigerator, feed it using the formula above, let it sit overnight at room temperature, and then return it to the refrigerator. It’s helpful to designate a specific day of the week to feed it so you don’t lose track.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxnl">
						<p class="bxnl">To wake a sleeping starter for baking…Feed refrigerated starter about 12 hours before you plan to use it and then let it sit at room temperature. A starter that’s fed the night before will be ready the next morning.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxnl">
						<p class="bxnl">To grow your starter for bigger batches of dough…The Basic Sourdough recipe (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_68">this page</a>) will leave enough starter for future batches. If you’re scaling up for a larger batch, double the portion you take from your mother and double the feeding formula for the starter.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="bxt1f">THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bxbl">
						<p class="bxbl">If your starter is growing, is bubbly, and is sour smelling, it’s in good shape.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxbl">
						<p class="bxbl">If your starter has been left for a long time in the refrigerator, it will separate into liquid on top and a darker mass below. Dump out the liquid and feed the base.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxbl">
						<p class="bxbl">If your starter is moldy, toss it out and begin anew.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxbl">
						<p class="bxbl">If you’re feeding your starter weekly, 24 hours outside of the refrigerator without a feeding should be enough to get your starter going.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="bxbl">
						<p class="bxbl">If you’re feeding your starter monthly, you’ll need 48 hours outside of the refrigerator and two feedings.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IF YOU HAVE</span> successfully made your starter, congratulations. You are now ready to create Arab sourdough bread. Sourdough can be used for most of the bread recipes in this chapter. Refer to Using Ratios (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_59">this page</a>) to scale up or down based on the percentages provided for each ingredient below.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Because this dough is made with sourdough starter and not commercial yeast, this recipe performs best when the dough is allowed to ferment in the refrigerator overnight. The slow fermentation allows the natural yeast to do its job, developing flavor and airiness in the dough. So, for best results, make this dough a full 24 hours before you plan to use it.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 cups/480ml (57%) water</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup/60g (7%) Basic Sourdough Starter (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_66">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">6 cups/840g (100%) bread flour</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons/18g (2%) kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons/45ml (5.6%) neutral oil, such as sunflower, plus more for greasing the bowl</p>
			<p class="rpf">To mix by hand: In a large bowl, combine the water, starter, and 3 cups/420g of the flour and use a sturdy wooden spoon to mix until everything comes together and forms a viscous, white gooey batter. Set aside, uncovered, at room temperature for 20 minutes. Add the remaining 3 cups/420g flour, salt, and oil and work together with your hands, squeezing the dough between your thumb and fingers in a lobster claw–type movement, until the mass forms a rough and shaggy ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, springs back when dimpled, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Combine the water, starter, and 3 cups/420g of the flour and, using the paddle attachment, mix until everything comes together and forms a viscous, white gooey batter. Set aside, uncovered, at room temperature for 20 minutes. Switch to the dough hook and add the remaining 3 cups/420g flour, salt, and oil. Mix at medium speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Form the dough into a ball. Then coat a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel and let it sit for about 4 hours in a warm draft-free spot in your kitchen.</p>
			<p class="rp">Proceed with your bread recipe or if you are not planning to use the dough right away, place the bowl in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to use, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set it out at room temperature 1 hour before baking.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes ten 8-inch breads</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IT’S AMAZING TO</span> think that pita bread, or as we call it khobz arabi, became popular as an American food within my lifetime. While I was growing up, it was a rarity to find it unless we made our way to the Arab markets. My mom used to carve out some special room in the freezer to store the stacks we needed for our weekend breakfast mezze or for gatherings of guests. For those, she would flip the flat rounds back and forth over the open flame of our stove, filling the kitchen with the smell of fresh toasty bread.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Over time, I’ve tasted Arab breads in every imaginable size and thickness. This recipe makes ten 8-inch breads with just enough heft to give them a nice chew, although slightly thicker than the Lebanese pita we had growing up. If you like a “chubbier” pita, feel free to roll out to 6 inches instead. If you want a thinner pita, divide the dough into 12 pieces.</p>
			<p class="rhn">No matter how many times I make this recipe, I never tire of the sight of my bread rising into a beautiful bubble as it cooks. If the dough is strong and the heat is high, it will hold a lovely crust without deflating. To this day, I try to bake a symmetrical pocket evenly thick on both crusts. No matter the width, these beautiful breads go perfectly with just about any recipe in this book and form the base for an infinite combination of toppings.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is easy to make and freezes well if you have any leftovers—which would never happen in my household. My three-year-old son leaves no pita unconquered. Leftovers can also be repurposed for Fattet Lahme wa Hummus (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_159">this page</a>) or Salatet Fattoush (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_211">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 recipe Basic Yeasted Dough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_69">this page</a>) or Basic Sourdough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_68">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">All-purpose flour for dusting</p>
			<p class="rpf">Divide the prepared risen dough into 10 pieces (about 137 grams each). Shape the pieces into rounds (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_62">this page</a>), cover with a dry dish towel (or brush the dough with a bit of oil and cover gently with plastic wrap), and let rest for 20 minutes. If you are not baking right away, you can also shape and set aside in the refrigerator up to 24 hours until you are ready to bake.</p>
			<p class="rp">When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500°F. Arrange the oven racks on the upper and lower thirds of the oven; if you are using a baking stone, remove the lower rack from the oven, place the stone on the floor of the oven, and preheat the oven for at least 45 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dough rounds on a lightly floured work surface, sprinkle them with flour, and pat each round into a 4-inch disk. Working your way around the rim of each disk, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the edges and stretch out the dough. (If the dough is resistant, allow the round to rest, covered with plastic wrap or a dish towel, for another 5 to 10 minutes.) Once you have pinched around the whole circle, sprinkle with a light dusting of flour. Continue the process for the remaining disks.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a rolling pin, roll out each round, up and then down once, shift a quarter turn and repeat the process, dusting with flour as needed, until you have an 8-inch disk. Continue the process for the remaining disks. Let the disks rest for another 5 minutes. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" role="doc-pagebreak" title="72"/>If space is limited, stagger your disks on top of each other and dust with an ample amount of flour.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle a thin layer of flour over two inverted sheet trays and place two or three disks on each one. To give the pita room to rise, remove the top rack of the oven. Place one of the sheet trays on the lower rack for 2 to 3 minutes or until the pita rise into a bubble and you see pleasing spots of brown.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the sheet tray from the oven and transfer the pita in a single layer to a wire rack so they keep their shape. Place your next prepared sheet tray in the oven while your first sheet tray cools. Repeat the process, rotating between the two sheet trays, until all of your pita breads have been baked.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • If you’re feeling brave and have a dough peel, you can also cook the khobz arabi directly on the baking stone for about 3 to 7 minutes or until the pita rises.</p>
			<p class="rn2">Cooled pita can be stored in a resealable bag at room temperature for 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months. To serve pita from frozen, throw them in the oven at 450°F for about 5 minutes. Enjoy this bread with all of your favorite mezze dishes.</p>
			<div class="bxboxO">
				<p class="bxt" id="page_71a">KHOBZ OR PITA?</p>
				<p class="bxf">We call the flat round bread that is known as pita in the West, khobz arabi (Arab bread) or pita. It is unclear how the word <i>pita</i> caught on in the English language, but we know it is borrowed from the Greek word for bread. This word, <i>pisomi</i>, traces back to the ancient Greek word for “fermented pastry,” which then made its way into Latin as <i>picta</i> (ever wonder why pizza sounds so similar?).</p>
				<p class="bx">Bread itself has prehistoric roots in the Fertile Crescent, the boomerang-shaped region spanning from Syria to Iran that is known for its irrigation techniques and agriculture. Going all the way back to the Neolithic period, when people first learned to domesticate crops like wheat and barley, bread making marked our transition from hunter gatherers to makers and cultivators. The first known records for bread making originate in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). Travelers and conquerors passing through the region brought the bread they had encountered and its methods back to their own cultures. That is the reason why Turkish, Greek, and Arab breads are so similar. Whether you call these breads khobz or pita, it’s good to know the origin.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SAJ BAKING REQUIRES</span> the development of savvy culinary hands. I’ve been told that I’m not the only one who was hypnotized while watching women in Lebanese and Syrian villages spinning dough from one hand to the other, the disk thinning and expanding with each toss until becoming nearly translucent. The sheet of dough is then stretched on a stiff, round canvas-covered cushion and smacked onto a steel-carbon dome, kept hot by a massive burner emitting concentric flames, or wood fire if you’re going old school, beneath it. Within seconds, the dough begins bubbling. It’s then either topped with an herb mix like Za’atar (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_24">this page</a>) or flipped and cooked into a flatbread.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In my early quest to make bread to order for customers, I sent my uncle on a quest deep into the mountains of Lebanon to fabricate artisan griddles just for me. Eventually, two saj griddles arrived via Air France, and I got them released from the airport customs impound just in time for our debut at the San Francisco Ferry Building farmers’ market, one of the most acclaimed markets in the country and the place that eventually built our fan base and helped land us our first brick-and-mortar location.</p>
			<p class="rhn">People gravitated to our stand like moths to a flame, mesmerized, just as I had been, watching the dough stretched and slapped on the hot saj with a resounding smack and then sprinkled with za’atar or cheese.</p>
			<p class="rhn">You can make this bread in your home by creating a makeshift saj from an inverted wok 10 to 16 inches in diameter.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The bread goes by many names, shrak for Palestinians, markook for Lebanese: whatever you call it, it’s delicious. Eat saj bread dipped in mezze spreads or as a wrap for sandwiches as in Musakhan (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_173">this page</a>).</p>

Working your way around the rim of each disk, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the edges and stretch out the dough. (If the dough is resistant, allow the round to rest, covered with plastic wrap or a dish towel, for another 5 to 10 minutes.)</p>
			<p class="rp">Once all of the 6 pieces are ready, invert a wok, bottom side up, over your largest stove burner and set the heat to medium.</p>

When the disk is big enough to fit the knuckles of both hands beneath it, stretch gently in opposite directions, rotating 90 degrees between stretches. Continue the process, until you have a 12- to 14-inch disk. Gradually ease your knuckles out toward the edges to create an even round and to keep the center from thinning too much.</p>

As the disk grows, let it drape across your palm and onto your forearm. Continue inverting the dough from palm to palm with quarter spins, making a motion that resembles an infinity loop, until it stretches to 12 to 14 inches. The more of your arm you use, the less likely the dough is to break.</p>

			<p class="rp">Once the dough is ready, flip each disk onto your makeshift saj; it should bubble and brown in under a minute. The dough can be moved around if an undercooked area needs access to a hotter part of the saj’s surface.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make mana’eesh, spread or sprinkle on a topping (see <a href="c03.xhtml#page_78">this page</a>) as soon as the bread hits the surface of the saj; otherwise, flip the dough and brown both sides. Repeat the same process with each piece of dough. Stack the bread in a basket lined with a dish towel and serve warm.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cooled bread can be folded and stored in a resealable bag at room temperature for 2 days or frozen for up to 6 months. To serve from frozen, thaw over a stove flame, in a toaster, or in the oven and serve warm.</p>

			<p class="rhnf" id="page_77b"><span class="upper">THE MAN’OUSHE</span><span class="upper"> (SINGULAR</span> for mana’eesh) is the quintessential street food of the Levant. Wherever you go in the streets of Damascus, Beirut, or Jerusalem, you’ll see professionals, students, families, and their children all enjoying piping hot flatbreads, usually slathered with herbaceous za’atar. They’re eaten while walking down the street on the way to work or school, sitting in cafés, or around the breakfast table. Among my favorite memories in Syria and Lebanon is heading to one of the corner bakeries and ordering flatbreads by the dozen. Slid right out of the oven into pizza boxes, my cousins and I would rush back to an aunt or uncle’s home and devour them without a single word exchanged.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In today’s Arab world, bakeries offer book-length menus of every imaginable topping. But in the old days, according to my mother, every household would bring their own special toppings to the local baker, whether it was a family-secret za’atar formula or homemade cheese, to bake fresh in the inferno of an open oven.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I hope to one day bring back the tradition of the “communal oven.” At the beginning of my bakery journey, I obsessed over Barbara Massoud’s book <span class="i">Man’oushé.</span> With its beautiful illustrations of flatbreads, it became my bible as I methodically worked, through trial and error, to perfect my dough. The more I read about mana’eesh, the greater my certainty that these flatbreads were the missing piece in Arab immigrants’ US food experience.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 recipe Basic Yeasted Dough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_69">this page</a>) or Basic Sourdough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_68">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">All-purpose flour for dusting the dough</p>
			<p class="ril">Semolina flour for dusting the pan</p>
			<p class="rilh">Za’atar-Oil Topping</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup Za’atar (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_24">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="rpf">Divide the prepared risen dough into 8 pieces (about 170 grams each). Shape the pieces into rounds (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_62">this page</a>), cover with a dry dish towel (or brush the dough with a bit of oil and cover gently with plastic wrap), and let rest for another 30 minutes. If you are not baking right away, you can also shape and set aside in the refrigerator until you are ready to bake.</p>
			<p class="rp">When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500°F. Arrange the oven racks on the upper and lower thirds of the oven; if you are using a baking stone, remove the lower rack from the oven, place the pizza stone on the floor of the oven, and preheat the oven for at least 45 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the dough rounds on a lightly floured work surface, sprinkle them with flour, and pat each round into a 4-inch disk. Working your way around the rim of each disk, use your thumb and index finger to pinch the edges and stretch out the dough. (If the dough is resistant, allow the round to rest, covered with plastic wrap or a dish towel, for another 5 to 10 minutes.) Once you have pinched around the whole circle, sprinkle with a light dusting of flour. Continue the process for the remaining disks.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using a rolling pin, roll out each round, up and then down once, shift a quarter turn, and repeat the process, dusting with flour as needed, until you have a 10-inch disk. Continue the process for the remaining disks. If space is limited, stagger your disks on top of each other and dust with an ample amount of flour. Let the disks rest for another 5 minutes</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the za’atar-oil mixture: In a small bowl, combine the za’atar and oil, gradually whisking or stirring until it is the texture of a viscous pesto.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle a thin layer of semolina flour over an inverted sheet tray and place one disk on it. Spoon about 2 tablespoons (about 1 ounce) of the za’atar-oil topping onto the dough and use the back of the spoon to spread it nearly to the edges, leaving about a ⅛-inch rim.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the sheet tray on the upper rack and bake for 2 minutes, until bubbles start to form and the bread starts to develop a crust. Remove the sheet tray from the oven and, with tongs (or your hands if you dare!), transfer the par-baked flatbread directly onto the bottom rack or onto the stone and bake until the edges and the crust are brown about 3 minutes more. Repeat the process with the remaining rounds. Enjoy it sliced like a pizza or rolled up.</p>
			<p class="rvh" id="page_77a">Variation: Za’atar and Cheese Topping “Cocktail” Style</p>
			<p class="rv">This is a Lebanese favorite, for those who prefer two different toppings on the same flatbread. To make, spread 1 tablespoon of the za’atar-oil topping on one-half of the round and ¼ cup of grated melting cheese, such as mozzarella or Oaxaca, on the other half. Leave a ⅛-inch rim all around. Then bake according to the directions.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • If you’re feeling brave and have a dough peel, you can also cook the flatbread directly on the baking stone for about 5 to 7 minutes or until the edges and bottom of the dough are spotted and golden.</p>

				<p class="sb">When I told my mother that I wanted to open a restaurant centered on man’oushe, her first reaction was, “You have to call it something else.” After all, Arabic words were confusing enough for Arabic speakers—how would I help the American public know what to call it? I remember people asking me, “So, is it mana’eesh or man’oushe?” The easy answer, it’s both!</p>
				<p class="sb">Man’oushe is singular and mana’eesh is plural. Just as the English language has different ways to pluralize words, the Arabic language has innumerable ways as well. To educate our customers and have fun describing the food, we put up signs saying: “It’s pronounced <i>Man-ooo-Shay</i>! It’s okay. We’ll still love you and feed you—even if you can’t pronounce it.” Or “It’s kinda like an Arab pizza. But not really.…” We used illustrations describing many ways to eat a man’oushe. In no time, we had customers with no prior connection to Arab culture walking up and pronouncing the man’oushe of their choice perfectly and without hesitation because it had become part of their daily routine.</p>
				<p class="sb">When Reem’s started as a market stand in San Francisco’s Mission District, I would glimpse people walking by with a warm man’oushe in one hand and in the other, a bag of fresh produce. It was so magical that I might very well have been walking in the streets of Beirut.</p>
				<p class="sb">Every time I hear this, I smile from ear to ear, knowing that an organic culture shift is underway. And I remember the response I gave to my mom: “Man’oushe will be in the English language of our future. It’s that good.”</p>

				<p class="sbt">The Armenian Influence on Lahm bi Ajeen</p>
				<p class="sb">Baalbek-style, Aleppo-style, Armenian-style—many have adapted this bread. Some like it a little sweeter, with pomegranate molasses. Some a little spicier. As with many foods that travel, lahm bi ajeen is known by several names, including lahmajun, most notably in Turkey. Though the origins of the dish come from the Arabic name (which literally translates to “meat in dough”), it was Armenians, working in Ottoman kitchens, who introduced and then propagated the dish. Treated as second-class citizens after their conquest by the Ottomans, Armenians suffered a wrenching genocide, still unrecognized by Turkey, in World War I. For Armenians, as for Palestinians, the preservation of their food became key to resisting their erasure.</p>
				<p class="sb">In every community where they found refuge, Armenians have excelled culinarily, particularly in the bakeries. In Bourj Hammoud, Beirut’s Armenian neighborhood, Armenian bakers pump out thousands of lahm bi ajeen every day in bakeries that stud the one-mile stretch of little Armenia. I sometimes joke that if the Arabs and Turks are fighting over their claim to something, chances are, it’s Armenian. Such is the case with lahm bi ajeen.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 8 bread pouches</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS IS ONE</span> of my all-time favorite breads in the Arab world. I have vivid childhood memories of old men on horse-drawn carts slinging toasty-brown loop-shaped loaves to passersby. There’s something irresistible and tantalizing about bread stacked on a tall stick or hanging fresh from wire hoops, in much the same way as it’s hard to pass up funnel cakes flying fresh out of the booth at a state fair.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Many vendors keep bowls of Khalta Harra (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>), a chile-spice mix; Za’atar (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_24">this page</a>); or sumac on hand and split the puffy pouch of the bread to stuff with these spices and occasionally with Picon cheese, an iconic French brand of semi-soft spreadable cheese, introduced to Lebanon in the 1960s during my mother’s childhood. She enjoyed these school-morning snacks, grabbed straight from the carts, some of which were even equipped with little toasters to serve them piping hot.</p>
			<p class="rhn">You can also use these pouches as buns for sandwiches such as the Kafta (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_179">this page</a>) or Falafel Mahshi (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_153">this page</a>).</p>

			<p class="rpf">Follow the instructions for making the dough through its first rise and until it has doubled in size. Gently ease the dough from the bowl, cradling it with both hands to minimize deflation.</p>
			<p class="rp">Divide the dough into 8 pieces (about 170 grams each). Tuck the edges under, as if you are starting the process of making rounds (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_62">this page</a>). Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place a round, smooth side down, on a lightly floured work surface. Gently tug the sides and then fold the left and right ends to meet in the center. Pinch the ends to form a 4-inch seam in length, resulting in an elongated round. Flip and rotate the round 90 degrees, so the wide side now faces you. To seal the seam, flip the round, seam side down, and cradle it between your index fingers and thumbs, rocking the dough back and forth a few times against the friction of the table, until the dough has tightened. Your dough should start to look like a football. Repeat with the remaining pieces and place them on a lightly oiled sheet tray.</p>
			<p class="rp">Leave the pieces of dough, covered with plastic wrap or a dish towel, to proof in a draft-free place for 2 hours, until they are puffed and doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the dough from the baking tray and shape each piece into a “purse,” a rounded pouch, topped with thinner handles. Gently tug the pointy ends of each inflated football and roll them out under your palms, until the dough resembles a 10- to 12-inch-long baguette with a fat belly and skinny tapered ends. Repeat the process for the remaining pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">Return to the first piece, wrap one end over the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" role="doc-pagebreak" title="86"/>other, tuck the tail beneath, and gently press to seal, forming a lopsided circle. Gently press the pouch of the purse—the loop’s fatter center—to flatten it. As you do so, the size of the hole will shrink to about an inch. Repeat the process for the remaining pieces.</p>

			<p class="rp">Place the sesame seeds in a shallow tray. Using a spray bottle or pastry brush, lightly coat the top of each purse with water. Dunk the wet side into the sesame seeds.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle a thin layer of semolina flour over a sheet tray. Flip each purse, sesame side up, onto the prepared sheet tray. Let the dough rest, covered with plastic wrap or a dish towel, for another 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature. They are ready when an indentation remains after you’ve pressed your finger into the dough.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 500°F. Place the water in a shallow nonglass pan at the bottom of the oven to create a steam effect; this will help the loaves expand properly and develop a nice crust.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bake for 6 minutes and then rotate and bake for another 6 minutes, or until the crust and seeds take on a deep golden-brown color.</p>
			<p class="rp">Ka’ak are delicious eaten warm, or they will last a few days stored in a paper bag at room temperature and used for sandwiches or toast.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • One way to create a proofer to aid the yeast in its important work and cut your time in half is to place the dough, uncovered, on the middle rack of a closed, turned-off oven above a pan filled with 2 to 3 cups of boiling water on the bottom rack. Let the dough sit for 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 24 turnovers</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">EQUALLY AT HOME</span> on the plates of vegans and meat lovers alike, spiced spinach and onion flavors burst from these pyramid-shaped, crispy-seamed turnovers. The trick to a perfect seal is to squeeze out as much moisture as possible from the spinach mixture before placing it on the dough, so that when the spinach cooks, it won’t steam and pop the pie open, exposing its innards for all to see. If your pie opens, don’t be hard on yourself. My mom never cared. The turnovers are still equally as delicious!</p>
			<p class="rhn">I always thought of fatayer as a baking affair prepared by women to be enjoyed at a big azoumeh, which in Arabic translates to “house party.” So, I was shocked the first time I saw burly men making them en masse in bakeries in Lebanon, where men hold more of the large-scale production-type jobs.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Fatayer makes a great seasonal dish as well. It can be stuffed with chard, purslane, lamb’s-quarters, or a host of greens that are often used in Lebanon. Starting with triple-washed baby spinach that is widely available and reasonably priced saves the extra step of rinsing and drying and will give you a head start on producing spinach with a minimum of water content.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This same dough is used in other turnover recipes: Fatayer Jibneh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_92">this page</a>) and Sfeeha Ba’albekiyyeh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_90">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rilhf" id="page_87a">Fatayer Dough</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup/180ml warm water (about 100°F)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/4g active dry yeast</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon/4g sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">2¾ cups plus 1 tablespoon/385g all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/5g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup/80ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the bowl</p>
			<p class="rilh">Filling</p>
			<p class="ril">12 cups/32g spinach leaves, cleaned and coarsely chopped</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons/5g kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups/280g red onion, finely diced (about 1 small red onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">⅓ cup/80ml extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon/15ml lemon juice (about ½ lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon/2g lemon zest</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoon/18g sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon/1g freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon/0.5g ground allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup/60g toasted pine nuts or coarsely chopped toasted walnuts (optional)</p>
			<p class="rils">Olive oil for brushing the tops</p>
			<p class="rpf" id="page_87b">To make the dough: In a small bowl, combine ¼ cup/60ml of the water with the yeast and sugar and set aside in a draft-free space for 10 minutes or until foamy.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Using your hands, slowly drizzle in the oil until the flour forms a fine crumble. Form a well inside the crumble, add the yeast mixture and the remaining ½ cup/120ml water, and use your hands to pull the flour mixture into the wet mix a little at a time. Continue working with your hands, until you get shaggy pieces of dough. Turn out onto a flat work surface and knead until the dough is smooth, dimples, and stretches like a windowpane (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_61b">this page</a>). This usually takes up to 10 minutes of kneading (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_59a">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Using the paddle attachment on low speed, slowly drizzle in the oil, until the flour forms a fine crumble. Switch to the dough hook and add the yeast mixture and the remaining ½ cup/120ml water and mix on medium speed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 8 to 10 minutes. You should hear the dough slap the sides of the bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Form the dough into a ball. Then coat a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm draft-free place for 1½ hours or until doubled in size. If you are not planning to use the dough right away, refrigerate for up to 12 hours, until doubled in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: In your largest bowl, sprinkle the spinach with the salt. Rub the salt into the leaves, using your hands, and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, in a separate medium bowl, combine the onion with the oil, lemon juice and zest, sumac, pepper, allspice, and pine nuts.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the spinach has softened, scoop as much as you can hold in one hand, cup it with your other hand, and squeeze it over a sink to draw out excess water. Continue removing as much moisture as possible from the remaining spinach and then add it to the onion-spice mix until it has all been incorporated. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the turnovers: When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and, using a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough into quarters. Cut each of the quarters into 6 pieces for a total of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" role="doc-pagebreak" title="88"/>24 pieces (about 25 grams each). Shape each piece into a smooth round (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#page_62">this page</a>) and place on a sheet tray. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel and let the rounds rest for another 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Working with about six rounds at a time, roll out or hand-press each round on a lightly floured work surface with a floured rolling pin or floured fingers, flipping the dough and dusting beneath with flour, until the dough is ⅛ inch thick and each round is about 4 inches in diameter. Cover the remaining rounds with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel to prevent them from drying.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line an 8 by 13-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">Mound 2 packed tablespoons of the filling in the center of each disk. Lift three edges of the circle with one hand, holding the point where they meet at the center and, with the other hand, pinch the seams together from top to bottom to form pronounced ridges (about ⅛ inch) along the seams (see <a href="c03.xhtml#page_92a">this page</a>). Make sure to pinch the seams together well to prevent the spinach from bursting out of the dough while the disks cook. If your seams are not closing, it may mean your dough has dried. Dip your finger in a bowl of water and trace the edges of the disks to hydrate. Repeat this process four more times, until all of the turnovers have been shaped.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the turnovers on the prepared sheet tray ¼ inch apart, brush the ridges with oil to accentuate the crunch, and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the sides turn golden and the ridges darken to a caramel color. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once cooled, the turnovers can be stored in an airtight container in the freezer for 3 months and can be reheated, directly from the freezer, in the oven.</p>

			<p class="rt">Baalbek-Style Meat Turnovers</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 24 turnovers</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">JUICY ON THE</span> inside and crisp along the corner seams, these small savory squares of dough that encase exquisitely spiced meat are emblematic of Baalbek, a city at the center of the Beqaa Valley, known as the Fertile Crescent in the north of Lebanon and the “Napa” of Lebanon. I’ve always been drawn to Baalbek, which traces its history back thousands of years, including conquests by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Ottoman Empire. Right along with the Roman temples, sfeeha are among the region’s top tourist attractions.</p>
			<p class="rhn">On the outskirts of Baalbek, the road to the Syrian border is studded with bakeries and butcheries, where you can pick up a favorite meat mix at one spot and ferry it down the street to a bakery to spread on a flatbread or tuck into a pastry. On road trips from Lebanon to Syria, my family loved stopping at these spots for lunch to watch bakers produce these turnovers at lightning speed, pinching precise balls off the big mound of dough with machinelike precision to fill with raw meat and then bake in a high-heat hearth.</p>
			<p class="rhn">These turnovers work equally well on a mezze spread, as party appetizers, or as take-and-bake protein snacks. Proceed with caution, though: after one, it’s near-impossible to stop eating them.</p>

Bread-based dishes like this one, and the small dishes like olives and pickles that accompany them, can be served at any time of the day, from breakfast, to picnics, and right through to dinner.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe calls for Akkawi cheese and nigella seeds; both are commonly found in Arab markets. If you want to make this with ingredients on hand, you can substitute any crumbly melting cheese like mozzarella or Oaxaca and black sesame seeds.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 recipe Fatayer Dough (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_87a">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ cups melting cheese, such as Akkawi, mozzarella, or Oaxaca cheese</p>

			<p class="rpf">Follow the instructions for making the dough through to the point where it is portioned into 24 pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a food processor, pulse the cheese until you get a fine crumbled cheese. If you are using a drier cheese such as Akkawi, add a couple tablespoons of water to form a paste so that the cheese doesn’t fly around while you form the turnovers.</p>
