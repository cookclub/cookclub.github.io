			<p class="pt">Host Like an Arab</p>
			<p class="cepi">There came a moment each summer, during visits to my grandparents’ Los Angeles home, when my grandmother would declare the time had come for a mountain picnic. The trip meant leaving the heat of the San Fernando Valley for the San Gabriel Mountains to the north. After she finished her morning fenjan ‘ahwah, a tiny tapered ceramic cup of bitter morning coffee, my grandmother would fill not one, but two thermoses with Arabic coffee and another with maramiyah, Ceylon tea brewed with dried sage leaves from Palestine.</p>
			<p class="pf">Out came the coolers and ice packs to stow hunks of cheese wrapped in wax paper along with tomatoes protected in perfectly fitted plastic boxes. Fruits and cucumbers would be washed and packed into more boxes. She’d transfer her stash of roasted pumpkin and watermelon seeds into smaller bags and decant a pint or two from her gallon jug of home-spiced olives into travel-size containers. When everything was set, she’d ask if I wanted sweets, and a final tin of syrupy namoura semolina bars and nut-filled baklava would be nestled into the cooler.</p>
			<p class="p">In the fresh air and expansive view from the mountains, my grandmother’s joy was infectious. It was impossible not to get swept away by her enthusiasm. Hospitality, for her, was not restricted to the walls of her home. She could create the feeling of abundance wherever she was.</p>
			<p class="p">I wonder now if my grandmother’s outdoor rituals reminded her of the summers she had spent escaping Beirut’s heat for the mountains of Lebanon. Where my grandmother was over-the-top opulent (if two dessert options are good, three is surely better), my own disposition is fairly practical. For someone who has staked a claim in the food world on the principle of Arab hospitality, I’m not, actually, all that domestic. It’s not in my nature to scrub my house for you and lavish you with sweets, until you drag yourself away, a hand in the air, bursting at the seams. That person was my grandmother.</p>
			<p class="p">My grandmother Nabigha Anani, the fifth child of nine, was born in Jaffa (Yaffa in Arabic), Palestine, to an orange-growing family. At age ten, she and her siblings climbed aboard a raft, fleeing militia from pre-state Israel, who took over her uncle’s farm. Her family had refused to leave their land during forced land evacuations and were met with settlers, who extracted, at gunpoint, the cultivation techniques for producing the family’s Jaffa oranges, the product that had made the region famous. Her uncle was brought to the field and forced to watch his workers and foreman lined up before a trench and killed execution style. He was released to tell the story of the impossible brutality as a message to others: you will not be returning.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9" role="doc-pagebreak" title="9"/>My grandmother and her siblings were among the 700,000 Palestinians who were expelled in the spring of 1948 to create Israel. Many, like the workers on their farm, did not make it out alive. We call this time the <span class="i">Nakba</span>, Arabic for “the great catastrophe.”</p>
			<p class="p">The next seven years would find my grandmother recovering the bounce in her step and her sense of assuredness, even as she adjusted to life forty miles south of her family’s estate—as a refugee in Gaza. Her optimism and beauty made her hard to miss, and at age seventeen, she found herself trading glances with the handsome boy at the local Mercedes-Volkswagen dealership, as she passed by on her daily errands. The boy knew immediately that he was in love and made what would be the first of many stands on behalf of my grandmother, refusing his family’s matchmaking efforts and courting the girl who had won his heart.</p>
			<p class="p">That boy was my grandfather, Tahsin Kishawi, a teenager with an uncanny knack for numbers and hard-driving instincts, honed on the Palestinian National Football Team (what we call soccer here). My grandfather came from a prominent Gazan family with far-flung enterprises that included car dealerships, textiles, and citrus farms.</p>
			<p class="p">In the search for an heir to take over the family’s business interests, my grandfather, at age seventeen, was pulled from school for the role. Soon, his wholesale textile business picked up, and he bet big, expanding into an abandoned three-story Barclays Bank building in Gaza City. The gamble paid off, as the trickle of Egyptians arriving on charter buses from across the border turned into a flood. Late-night shoppers kept him open until 3 o’clock in the morning, as they pored over his selection of European fabrics that were no longer available in shops nationalized by Egypt’s new revolutionary president, Gamal Abdel Nasser.</p>

			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10" role="doc-pagebreak" title="10"/>My grandparents married soon after, and my grandfather’s businesses flourished. By the time my mother, their eldest, turned four, they had moved to a waterfront villa on the Mediterranean Sea. But in the summer of 1967, they were tipped off by a neighbor, a senior officer in the Egyptian military, about a pending invasion from Israel. They prepared a hasty trip to Lebanon, hoping to flee for a short while to avoid the same kind of violence that had made my grandmother a refugee. It was hard to imagine they wouldn’t be returning soon, so my grandparents packed a few personal items, withdrew twenty-five thousand liras, and rented a summer home in the Lebanese mountains. Over the course of the war, Israeli forces confiscated their Gaza home and all of the family businesses.</p>
			<p class="p">Summer turned to winter, and everyone remembers the chill in that home, equipped only for use during the warmer months. My grandfather recognized that Lebanon would now be his family’s new home, but he worried for their safety since the Lebanese government viewed Muslim Palestinian refugees as a demographic threat to the ruling Christian minority. Calling on a family connection, my grandfather secured Jordanian citizenship papers to conceal their Palestinian identity and signed the lease on an apartment in West Beirut, before heading to Kuwait to start a wholesale textile business to generate income for his family. There, he lived and slept in his shop for three years, saving up to rejoin the family and relaunch his business in Lebanon.</p>
			<p class="p">I’d like to think that I’ve inherited something of my grandfather’s entrepreneurial resilience. Over the course of his life, he built and rebuilt his businesses too many times to count, as the family bounced among seven countries. His second great loss came in the 1980s, when Lebanon’s civil war was five years underway. Shelling and bombing wiped out the textiles my grandfather stored in the port, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11" role="doc-pagebreak" title="11"/>and the retailers holding fabrics on commission defaulted. Once again, he lost nearly everything.</p>
			<p class="p">As they adjusted to the war, my grandmother and grandfather each assumed a role to secure the family’s safety and survival. He was the financial provider and she was determined to gird her family with thrift, and bread. The bakeries became a bombing target; she made sure my grandfather never stood in the bakery lines for bread and often baked her own, repurposing dry scraps into chips and puddings.</p>
			<p class="p">At gatherings, my family loves to tell the story of a time my grandmother, short on supplies, dashed out for lemons during a lull in the bombing. A local fisherman had supplied his fresh catch, and, as everyone knows, it’s impossible to serve fish without lemon. She made it down to the pier and found a lone vendor, trying to get out of the crossfire. Lemons in hand, she asked him whether rockets were coming from the east or the west. “Ma’am,” he replied in dry Lebanese fashion, “I didn’t ask them.”</p>
			<p class="p">On her way home, a rocket swept her down the street in its undertow, knocking her unconscious. When she awoke, she asked the person who’d pulled her to safety, “Am I in heaven?” And then, just as quickly, “Where are my lemons?”</p>
			<p class="p">One of the things that stands out to me, as the injustice of my grandparents’ stories rattles around in my bones, is my grandmother’s ebullience in the face of adversity. Despite seeing the worst of what people could do to each other, she brought an open heart to each place she landed.</p>
			<p class="p">The lifelong friendship she forged with her neighbor Rougie, a refugee like her, helped her feel more at home in Lebanon. Rougie had escaped to Palestine in 1944, when German Nazis invaded Hungary, her homeland. She was taken in by a Palestinian family and eventually met her husband, Simone, who was part of the resistance. They fled to Beirut after 1948, when Zionist militia invaded Simone’s home and killed his family.</p>
			<p class="p">Rougie and my grandmother sat together for coffee each morning, over Rougie’s sfoof, a lovely turmeric-infused cake that my grandmother would later add to her own baking repertoire. After they had shopped for groceries, she and Rougie would often spend afternoons in a salon, their hair set in curlers and nails painted to perfection. They had already seen the worst of two wars and were determined to preserve some sense of normalcy. The two shared a sisterly companionship against the backdrop of war. Later, when sectarian war endangered my grandmother’s family, Rougie would offer to house-sit the family’s apartment to secure it from Christian militia, who targeted Muslim homes.</p>
			<p class="p">The year 1982 was a turning point in the Lebanese Civil War. Israel bombarded Beirut by air, land, and sea in a scorched-earth campaign, cutting off food, water, and electricity in Palestinian refugee camps and neighborhoods. Under Israel’s military occupation, Lebanese militia entered the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps right outside of Beirut, and brutally massacred thousands of Palestinians and anyone thought to be supporting the Palestinian resistance. My grandparents knew they had to leave, once again, to keep the family safe.</p>
			<p class="p">My grandmother flew to the United States to help my newly immigrated mother settle in her new life, while the rest of the family found a way to escape through a Christian caravan, on the safest and shortest route out of East Beirut. The story goes that my grandfather, in a standoff at the checkpoint, turned the car around and left the caravan of travelers for a longer, but safer, road to Damascus. Later they found out the caravan had been bombed.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12" role="doc-pagebreak" title="12"/>A year later, the family returned to Lebanon, hoping to resume their lives. Instead, things had gotten even harder. While they had been gone, Harakat Amal, a Shiite Lebanese political party, had turned the family home into a staging area for fighters. The family received word that Harakat Amal was demanding a bounty for my grandfather on the pretext that objectionable political propaganda had been found in the home. They had uncovered a pamphlet in a stack of one of the kid’s school papers that promoted one of the opposition parties. It was not uncommon to target middle-class businessmen in order to raise funds for political parties.</p>
			<p class="p">While my grandfather was lying low at the home of one of his regular customers, my grandmother, back from the United States, resolved to clear my grandfather’s name and reclaim their apartment. She pushed her way past the militia into the commander’s office and convinced him to evict his team from the apartment. That night, to secure the home, she slept there alone. However, some of the militia, unhappy with their leader’s decision, placed a small deposit of dynamite sticks at the front door, in a jumble with family photos, souvenirs, and collectibles. The next morning, she opened her apartment door and gingerly stepped over the explosives to recover whatever memorabilia she could carry, then met up with my grandfather and declared, “We’re done.” The family climbed aboard a dinghy to Cyprus and from there, went on to Greece to start a new life.</p>
			<p class="p">Looking back, I sense my grandmother’s grit, facing risk with fearless determination. When I hear family retell the story, I also hear the echoes of my grandfather’s voice, shouting the words that trailed my grandmother, as she dashed out the screen door to the patio of their Los Angeles home, balancing a tray of Arabic coffee, or darting across the kitchen to lift a pot too heavy for her arthritic wrists: “<span class="i">Istenny! Istenny shway!</span> (Wait! Wait a sec!)” I love the irony of his protective gestures toward a woman unafraid to confront armed militia. Perhaps protecting each other had become, over time, reflexive.</p>
			<p class="p">I remember waking on family visits to find my grandmother in her lacy nightgown, smelling of face creams and tonics, her hair loosely curled, sitting at the kitchen table, a glass of tea in its saucer, peeling a head of garlic for the afternoon feast. I appreciated her enduring elegance; she never allowed her status as a refugee to define her. Her Palestinian identity was seen as a threat first in Lebanon and then again in the United States, and yet, she moved with grace and brought her gift for creating the warmth of Arab hospitality with her to each new home.</p>
			<p class="p">Upheaval, beginning with the rheumatic fever she had contracted when she fled to Gaza, left my grandmother with health issues, eventually leading to a heart condition and triple bypass surgery. A lifetime of medications and surgeries further weakened her system and resulted in dementia.</p>
			<p class="p">I barely knew my grandmother’s story. I only pieced it together after her death, learning versions of it from aunts and uncles and from my mother. My grandmother rarely spoke of the past, and as her memories faded, I lost my chance to ask. I didn’t link my own journey to hers at first. I just knew I longed for something that was missing. As I have built a business and a life of purpose, rooted in our Arab food ways, I’ve come to realize that my grandmother, who loaded the table to its edges with tasty morsels of my favorite foods, lives through me. I’m determined to tell the story of our family and of our people with the fire that ignited my grandmother and to live my life with joy, dignity, and maybe just a touch of her fashion sensibility.</p>
