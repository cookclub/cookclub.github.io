			<p class="pt">Street Corner Bakery</p>
			<p class="cepi">In the summer of 2010, my father, sister, and I arrived at Beirut–Rafik Hariri International Airport in Lebanon, to the kind of humidity that sends my curls fleeing in every direction. Before heading to my aunt’s house, my cousins took us on a detour to Beirut’s busy Hamra Street, packed with cafés and boutiques. We went there for one thing: hot out-of-the-oven mana’eesh.</p>
			<p class="pf">The shops displayed fresh flatbreads, laid out in giant edible mosaics with every imaginable combination of toppings. We paused for a moment of awe, bellies rumbling at the smell of za’atar spice, melty and briny cheese, cured and spiced ground meats, fresh herbs, fragrant chopped tomatoes and cucumbers, olives, and spicy peppers. If you couldn’t choose, the baker would gladly slather your man’oushe with two toppings, split right down the middle.</p>
			<p class="p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51" role="doc-pagebreak" title="51"/>It seemed as if every block had at least one bakery, sometimes more. I remember scanning menu boards that filled entire walls of small shops, reading options in both Arabic and English, with ingenious combinations—everything from mortadella and cheese to chicken tandoori. The possibilities seemed endless.</p>
			<p class="p">I wish I could say we perused all the choices, carefully assessing our options, but since everything looked so good, we just grabbed the first man’oushe we found. There are no wrong choices on Hamra Street. With a warm bread in hand, folded in half and wrapped in paper, we strolled together, taking in the sights, sounds, and food smells of a bustling city. For the first time in a long time, I felt alive.</p>
			<p class="p">A few blocks over, Bliss Street ran past my mother’s alma mater, the American University of Beirut (AUB), where students spilled out across the sidewalks, lining up for their favorite pick-me-ups from bakeries, eateries, and coffee shops. My sister, who had spent a semester at AUB, directed me to Snack Faysal, her favorite twenty-four-hour mana’eesh spot.</p>
			<p class="p">Munching on a man’oushe late one night, topped with Snack Faysal’s special za’atar double-cheese “cocktail” combo, I could see how starkly misunderstood Lebanon—and the rest of the Arab world—was by the people I knew back home. Far from the tropes of a single-minded citizenry holding out against modernity, Beirut is the only place where a Virgin Megastore with a rooftop bar overlooks a bullet-ridden mosque. On one street you could find a woman celebrating the results of her plastic surgery beneath a revealing blouse crossing paths with a religiously covered woman, and neither would give the other a second glance. People of every generation and religious background fill Beirut’s streets, all connecting through food, suspending judgment, and enjoying life side by side, bite by bite.</p>
			<p class="p">By the time of this trip, following bouts of physical and mental illness in childhood and college, I had overcome despair. I’d remade myself as a devoted organizer, knocking on doors by day to recruit community leaders in the fight for justice and wielding a bullhorn by night, calling for a free Palestine and an end to the US War on Terror. The campaigns I championed resulted in living wages and better working conditions for Black and Brown hotel and airport service workers, affordable housing for residents fighting to stay in their neighborhoods, money for schools, and political power for community leaders who gained the skills and confidence to run for elected seats.</p>
			<p class="p">Black Lives Matter was on the ascent, and racial justice was gaining steam. Although I was living the life I’d imagined for myself, a nagging feeling kept re-emerging. Increasingly, I found myself at loose ends, a community organizer without my own community. The life of an organizer meant round-the-clock hours and little time to build a life outside of work. I often felt alone. After years of fighting on the front lines for others’ voices to be heard, I had lost my own. I was burned out, and I desperately needed time to recharge. It was at this point my father asked me and my youngest sister, Manal, to take a trip with him to the homeland.</p>
			<p class="p">My father, Naim Assil, was born in Syria in 1946, the year that Syrians finally won independence from French colonial rule. That upheaval opened the way for revolutionary organizing. By high school, my dad’s encounters with Palestinians taking refuge in Syria had a greater pull than the spot that awaited him on an elite club basketball team. (He always laments that he could have gone pro.)</p>
			<p class="p">In neighboring Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser was leading the overthrow of Egypt’s dynastic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" role="doc-pagebreak" title="52"/>monarchy and nationalizing the Suez Canal, a blow to British colonial forces who controlled the country’s resources. Nasser’s compelling vision called for a unified nation of Arabs, fighting for self-determination on their lands. A generation of young organizers, including my father, joined the call for Pan-Arabism, hoping to build a better future.</p>
			<p class="p">To avoid mandatory service in the Syrian army, my father moved to Egypt to study at Alexandria University, where he took to the streets between studies, knocking on doors, striking up conversations about the new future Nasser promised. As Pan-Arab unity grew, Europe and America strengthened the forces backing Nasser’s opposition. The revolution collapsed, and thousands died fighting to preserve the housing, employment, health, education, and agricultural land they had gained through independence, gutting the dreams of my father and many in his generation. My father traded in his revolutionary fervor for an engineering career and turned to his faith, Islam, to guide his search for purpose.</p>
			<p class="p">By the time of this trip, nearly fifty years later, I was joining my father to visit the places that birthed his awakening. We were headed to Syria by way of Lebanon. I was there in search of my own purpose; he, to retrace the footsteps of his past and to show me where we’d come from.</p>
			<p class="p">My first days in Lebanon filled me with anxiety. I couldn’t shake the sensation that I was an onlooker. Did my name, my looks, my food make me Arab, even if my thoughts carried me elsewhere? Would I feel the same sense of belonging my dad felt at the sight of the landmarks and people who had shaped him? I would soon find out.</p>
			<p class="p">The next leg of our journey took us from Lebanon across the eastern border into Syria. The crossing was a revelation. The guards, taken with my father’s easy banter, waved us through, no passports needed. At home, no amount of documentation ever seemed sufficient to secure our place as Americans, and yet here, we were welcomed as kin, even before we had made it across the border. As we navigated toward the Assil family home in Damascus, the capital of Syria, I learned that at that point 180 people in the area called my father <span class="i">khaloo</span>, meaning “uncle.” Before each trip he took to Syria, my dad would map out his family tree—six sisters and two brothers, their children, and grandchildren—to plan the gifts he needed to bring and the stops he had to make. Sometimes it took some tape and extra paper to account for everyone, but still, to me, 180 felt like more Arabs than I’d ever met in my life.</p>
			<p class="p">Despite our lives apart, the family welcomed my sister and me, two “American” girls, as their own, which in the Syrian tradition meant feeding us endlessly. Their hospitality filled me with a joyful sense of belonging. In trying to find a word for the way in which Syrians care for others, it was described to me as <span class="i">hanan</span>, a beautiful word meaning, in this context, “warmhearted kindness.” What we lacked in language, with my choppy Arabic and their halting English, we made up for in humor and food. I wanted to freeze that sensation and take it home with me.</p>
			<p class="p">Each day centered on a big lunch, and we hopped from one home to the next to see family, feasting on treats like a side of Makdous (<a href="c08.xhtml#page_237">this page</a>), tiny baby eggplants, stuffed with a mix of sweet red peppers, walnuts, and garlic and then cured to tender perfection in olive oil. One weekend, we arrived at an aunt’s mountain summer home to find her flanked by a team of at least ten women, circled around a heaping pile of dough for kibbeh (see <a href="c05.xhtml#page_162">this page</a>), meat-filled bulgur croquettes to be fried later in the evening.</p>
			<p class="p">The country was celebrating Ramadan, and an hour after sunset, once their fast was broken, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" role="doc-pagebreak" title="53"/>families spilled out of homes and mosques to enjoy the nightlife. On every street corner, bakeries whose facades opened onto the street pushed out stacks of Arab bread to lines of families waiting to buy bags for the morning suhoor, the pre-sunrise meal to sate fasters for the long day ahead.</p>
			<div class="full_none">

			</div>
			<p class="p">Even families with little cash parked themselves on a patch of grass or dirt and brought out salty cheeses, breads, and cucumber spears accompanied by argeelah, a fruit-scented tobacco water pipe. They would strum ouds inlaid with mother-of-pearl to make beautiful lute-like melodies, while slapping out danceable rhythms on handheld tabla drums. Men walked the streets serving tea and street food like Ka’ak (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_85">this page</a>). The aroma of food filled every block. Shawarma and falafel shops anchored the street corners, and in between them, people sold fruits and nuts from the countryside.</p>
			<p class="p">Although the life I’d built was more than seven thousand miles away, it was here, sensing the ease among people, tasting fruits and vegetables from nearby farms, and grabbing loaves warm from the oven, that I felt most at home.</p>
			<p class="p">Each night of our trip, when others had drifted off to sleep, my father and I would stay up to reflect on our days, something we hadn’t done together in a long time. Leading up to the trip, we’d been nearly estranged. My path had veered far from his: I’d become an agnostic practicing Buddhism, an underpaid organizer, and an activist opposing the very government from whom he’d sought refuge. For years, he struggled to explain what I did for a living, but on this particular trip, Barack Obama’s presidency provided him an easy answer. He proudly declared, “She’s a community organizer, like Obama!” Faces would light up in recognition: “Ah! Like Obama!”</p>
			<p class="p">It was in those moments when I realized that my father’s reluctance to accept my organizing career was not due to a lack of understanding of it but more so a fear that I might experience the same disappointment he did after a thwarted revolution. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak" title="54"/>My father, who had worked so hard to cocoon me in safety, had a hard time releasing me into a world he feared would be unwelcoming to a girl who took the path less traveled.</p>
			<p class="p">At the apex of our trip, we planned an escape from the city life of Damascus to the coast of northwest Syria on a guided tour to see sights my father had visited in his youth. At each of our stops, we arrived at a community that doubled as a place of refuge in the Syrian countryside for Armenians, Kurds, Turkmen, and Assyrians. In this part of Syria, we were the tourists, and they, Syrians, who alternated between their language of origin and Arabic. They welcomed us with a flourish of hospitality, serving up dishes from their own traditions.</p>
			<p class="p">We ate in Kasab, an ethnically Armenian mountain village, that was mostly Christian. Our meal featured fresh herbs, paper-thin breads, pickled vegetables, and meats enhanced with sour fruit like green plums—distinct from the Arab dishes my family prepared. The next day, we stopped for lunch along the Mediterranean coast in the Turkmen village of Umm al-Tuyour. A café owner hosted us with a selection of fresh fish grilled to perfection, served with sprigs of mint and parsley and wedges of lemon.</p>
			<p class="p">The Syria my father had left behind was now a place of refuge for people who had been dislocated from their homes by borders and conflicts. Was I any less Syrian than those families I’d encountered who had migrated into the countryside, carrying on their traditions even as they assimilated into Syrian life?</p>
			<p class="p">One day, our bus pulled over along the highway for a sightseeing stop. Across the way, a roadside vendor tended a wood fire beneath the steel dome of her griddle. I dashed over for a closer look. I stood, transfixed, as the rest of the group moved on. I studied her method, as she expertly stretched even rounds of dough on a stiff pillow, its surface taut with thick canvas. She slammed stretched flatbreads onto the metal, which, I would later learn, is called a saj.</p>
			<div class="medium_img">
				<img alt="" class="image" id="image_page_54" src="../images/049_ASSI_9781984859075_lay_art_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="p">As soon as her dough hit the griddle, it began bubbling, and the steamy toasty smells made my mouth water. As she repeated the process, a thousand questions popped up inside me, but since I couldn’t make out her heavy mountain Arabic dialect, I resolved to watch, as she patiently showed me with her hands and eyes. I observed her seamless movements, rearranging the flame and coals beneath the saj, flipping and adjusting the dough on different parts of the dome where the heat was higher or lower to ensure a perfectly baked flatbread.</p>
			<p class="p">On our return to Damascus, I wanted to see more bread making. It turned out that one of my uncles owned a bakery inside the walls of the legendary old-city market Souq al Hamidiyah, so we went to see where the magic happened. Big mixers and tables for shaping dough gave me a sense of scale. Bags of Syria’s special high-protein wheat flour lined the walls. We didn’t know then that the Arab Spring was right around the corner. Neither did we know that the aftermath would produce a devastating war, resulting in wheat shortages that would force bakers to stretch their supplies with additions that would have been unthinkable then—cornmeal, barley, and even husks and bran. Bread is the lifeline of my people, so severing Arabs from their bread became a tactic of war on the Syrian people.</p>
			<div class="medium_img">
				<img alt="" class="image" id="image_page_55" src="../images/050_ASSI_9781984859075_lay_art_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="p">If bread is the lifeline of my people, then the bakery is king. Even when bakeries themselves became targets of military bombardment, people were willing to face rockets just to get their fix of daily bread. Each place where we stopped, even remote villages, had a bakery, whether run-down or well furnished. I loved overhearing bakers ask <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" role="doc-pagebreak" title="55"/>about school, work, and health, as they baked families’ homemade dough in the communal oven. The person who bakes the bread holds a special place as part of the extended family. I suddenly longed to be that baker. I longed for that kind of connection.</p>
			<p class="p">We made our way back to Beirut just days before our return to the United States, and I could already feel my loose ends coming back together through my discovery of bread, a vital implement for nearly every dish that Arabs eat. Bread is neither a rich nor poor food. It is the common denominator that connects us all.</p>
			<p class="p">I no longer remember all of the bakeries I saw in Lebanon and Syria. What I do remember is the feeling of life returning to my body after seeing mounds of savory and sweet breads. As far as the eye could see, there were stacks of Fatayer Jibneh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_92">this page</a>), Fatayer Sabanikh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_87">this page</a>), and Sfeeha Ba’albekiyyeh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_90">this page</a>), dough wrapped in perfect geometric shapes around either cheese, spinach, or lamb filling, sitting next to mounds of sweets: nut-stuffed Ba’laawa bil Jowz (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_118">this page</a>), Ghraybe (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_263">this page</a>) shortbread cookies, and date-stuffed Ma’amoul Med (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_260">this page</a>). I remember the revelation that a bakery can spark life even in places where life has been most depleted. I knew then that my ancestors were trying to tell me something: my community back in California needed an Arab street corner bakery.</p>
			<p class="p">As my plane taxied onto the runway at San Francisco International Airport, I was already composing my resignation letter in my head. In just a few weeks, I would quit my organizing job and enroll myself in culinary school.</p>
