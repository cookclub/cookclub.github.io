			<p class="ry">Makes 1 quart</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IF EVER THERE</span> was an iconic pickle of Levantine cuisine, it would be turnip. Delicious and a brilliant magenta, <span class="i">lifit</span>, the Arabic word for “turnip,” formed a kindling-shaped pyramid atop just about every mezze spread I ate growing up.</p>
			<p class="rhn">At Reem’s, when I think of colors that scream California, I think of the hot pink and appealing green combo of pickled turnips and olives, served side by side as a mezze or in a Falafel Mahshi (<a href="c05.xhtml#page_153">this page</a>). Our restaurant menu calls them “pickled purple things,” a feast for the eyes and the belly.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Lifit also brings back memories of Mid East–brand jars, hiding in the back of our refrigerator. My sister used to stash them out of sight to manage her pickle addiction. It’s easy and inexpensive to keep high-quality fresh pickles on hand. These pickles are at their best the first month or two after pickling, but they’re not likely to last that long, once you get the taste for their craveable, punchy pickle flavor. They’re equally good for snacking and for serving alongside just about every mezze spread, savory bread, and meat or veggie main in this book.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • You will need one 1-quart wide mouthed Mason jar with lid, sterilized.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 pound turnips</p>
			<p class="ril">1 red beet (about 5 ounces)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup apple cider vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heaping teaspoons black peppercorns</p>
			<p class="ril">1 serrano chile, stem removed</p>
			<p class="ril">5 garlic cloves, halved lengthwise</p>
			<p class="rpf">Peel the turnips, cut off the roots and stems, halve lengthwise, and with the flat sides down, slice each half lengthwise into ½-inch pieces. Slice the pieces into ½-inch-wide sticks. Do the same for the beet, except cut it half as thick. (Wear gloves, if you have them, to keep your hands from turning red.)</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, combine the vinegar, water, salt, and peppercorns and warm over low heat until the salt dissolves, then remove from the heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meanwhile, pierce the chile with the tip of a knife, making small incisions all over.</p>
			<p class="rp">Line the jar with layers of turnips and beets and wedge in the chile and garlic pieces. Pour in the pickling brine, leaving a ½-inch gap at the top. If the veggies begin to float, press a nonreactive weight or a crumpled sheet of parchment paper or wax paper over the vegetables to keep them submerged.</p>
			<p class="rp">Close the jar tightly and set aside at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, for 3 days. Gently tilt the jar from side to side each day to distribute the beet’s trademark magenta hue into the turnips.</p>
			<p class="rp">The turnip spears can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235" role="doc-pagebreak" title="235"/>months.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 2 quarts</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">TINY, SAVORY, SOUR,</span> and spicy stuffed eggplants are a prized delicacy in Lebanon and Syria. When they come into season, they sell out faster than we can stuff them at my restaurant. It takes about two weeks to develop their je ne sais quoi magical tang. Makdous are traditionally eaten as part of a mezze spread with bread for breakfast or as a late-night snack.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My grandmother, like home cooks across the Arab world, knew from experience to expel the eggplant’s water. Handling the peppers and garlic gently prevents them from leaching water. These tricks help differentiate flavorful, tender makdous from their soggy counterparts that risk spoilage.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • You will need one 2-quart wide mouthed Mason jar or two 1-quart wide mouthed Mason jars with lid(s), sterilized.</p>
			<p class="rilf">20 baby eggplants (the size of tennis balls), such as the Indian varietal (about 2 pounds)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rilh">Stuffing</p>
			<p class="ril">1 heaping cup walnuts</p>
			<p class="ril">3 large red bell peppers, cut into large chunks (about 1 pound)</p>
			<p class="ril">4 red Fresno chiles (about 4 ounces) or 2 green jalapeño chiles, stems, seeds, and veins removed</p>
			<p class="ril">12 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>); optional</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">Chopped parsley for serving</p>
			<p class="ril">Toasted walnuts for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">Fill a large pot three-quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Add the eggplants, then turn down the heat to medium and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes until the eggplants are just cooked through. The eggplants should preserve their vibrant color and be soft to the touch but not collapsing.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the eggplants with a slotted spoon, dunk them in a pot of ice water to stop the cooking process, and then drain in a colander.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cut or twist off each eggplant stem as close as possible to the top. At the midway point between the stem and the bottom, slit the side of the eggplant most of the way through, leaving the top, bottom, and opposite side intact. Squeeze each eggplant from top to bottom between your thumb and forefinger to open the slit, then rub about ¼ teaspoon of the salt (a generous pinch) into each cavity.</p>
			<p class="rp">Lay the eggplants slit side down in a colander and weight them with a heavy object, such as a pot, to press out the moisture. Leave them to drain for 4 to 12 hours, or overnight, in order to cure the flesh. The less water they retain, the better the eggplant will keep.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the stuffing: Finely chop or pulse the walnuts in a food processor or blender and transfer to a large bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Finely chop the bell peppers, chiles, and garlic or pulse them briefly in a food processor, taking care not to mash them, then add them to the walnuts along with the salt and Aleppo pepper.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238" role="doc-pagebreak" title="238"/>Once the eggplant has drained, use your fingers to stuff each cavity with the filling (about 2 tablespoons per eggplant), until just full but not overflowing.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the oil to the jar. Pack the eggplants against each other in the jar as tightly as possible, slit sides against the sides of the jar, immersing each layer in the oil as you go, ensuring every cranny is saturated.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the eggplants are packed and completely submerged in oil, seal the jar tightly. Set the jar away from direct sunlight for 7 to 10 days. Serve as a mezze course, drizzled with fresh oil and sprinkled with chopped parsley and toasted walnuts.</p>
			<p class="rp">Unopened, the eggplants can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 year. After opening, they will keep in the refrigerator for 6 months or longer. To avoid spoilage, add more oil and swirl it around the jar every time you take out makdous to eat.</p>

			<p class="rt">Sun-Colored Pickled Cauliflower</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 2 quarts</p>
			<p class="rhn"><span class="upper">ARAB CUISINE IS</span> as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the belly. I use turmeric to turn these cauliflower florets yellow, adding to the mosaic of colors in our mixed pickle spreads. Sun-colored cauliflower makes an excellent pairing in both color and flavor with the magenta Lifit (<a href="c08.xhtml#page_234">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note</span> • You will need one ½-gallon Mason jar or two 1-quart wide mouthed Mason jars with lid(s), sterilized.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 cauliflower head (about 20 ounces)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups white champagne vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">One 2-inch piece fresh turmeric, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
			<p class="rpf">Cut away the stem and leaves of the cauliflower and reserve for another use. Carve away the stem’s core, angling the knife toward the center of the cauliflower (the core and other scraps are great roasted or turned into soup). Break apart the florets and continue cutting the cauliflower until it’s reduced to bite-size pieces, about ½ inch in size.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, combine the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and turmeric over medium heat and warm just until the salt and sugar dissolve.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 2 cups</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">PEOPLE WHO KNOW</span> me best know that the quickest way to my heart involves sour candies. The minute I see a bag of sour gummies slipped onto my desk I know it’s a bribe, and I gladly accept it.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Growing up, candy was hard to come by—my mom was a stickler when it came to sugar. I managed to feed my cravings by smuggling goods from my sister’s job at the local penny candy store and cutting side deals with my dad for chocolates to feed both of our addictions.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is my sour-candy adaptation of a traditional recipe I used to enjoy at my Syrian piano teacher’s house. She was known in the Boston music scene for playing her Arab classical music both on the piano and the oud, the traditional sitarlike instrument; she often played to sold-out shows. I always wanted to learn her greatest hits, but she insisted we stick to Western classical music to build my foundation. Despite the missed opportunity, I felt lucky to be welcomed into a home rich with Syrian traditions—the food especially—at my weekly piano lessons.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The secret sour ingredient in this candy is sumac, which perfectly pairs with the pomelo’s blossomy fragrance, making a naturally sweet and sour candy. I add citric acid or dried lime for extra punch, but sumac works fine on its own if you don’t have the other ingredients. Pomelos, which look like giant grapefruits, are often available in Asian shops. They’re among the many fruits Arabs share in common with the rest of the Asian world. Grapefruits make a fine substitute if pomelos are unavailable.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe uses the spongy pith. The pith absorbs the syrup, giving it a soft and luscious texture, almost like a gummy. Because the outer rind is bitter, especially in pomelos, the trick to this recipe is to remove the zest and leach out as much bitterness as possible.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Candying the pith and zest make a great way to use the extra parts of the pomelo fruit, saving the sweet fruit inside for snacking or to toss over salad. (See Candying Zest on <a href="c08.xhtml#page_242">this page</a>.)</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 pomelo or 2 grapefruits</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons dried lime</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon citric acid (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Peel the zest from the pomelo rind using a vegetable peeler. Cut away the stem end of the pith. Use a paring knife to quarter the pith, scoring it down to the fruit. Peel away the pith and cut the pith lengthwise into strips of matching width and thickness.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, immerse the strips in just enough water to cover and use a lid smaller than the pot to hold the pith under the water. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then drain in a colander. Cover again with cold water. Repeat this step twice more, reducing the length of each boil to about 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a wide saucepan large enough to accommodate a single layer of strips, bring the pith, 2 cups of the sugar, and the water to a boil over medium heat. Add the lemon juice, then turn down the heat to a simmer and cook until the strips appear translucent, with an almost glass-like appearance, and have absorbed most of the syrup, about 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Set a wire rack over a large pan, remove the pith with a slotted spoon or tongs, and spread the slices on the rack to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">Grind the dried lime to a fine powder in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Then combine the ground lime, sumac, and citric acid with the remaining ½ cup sugar in a medium bowl.</p>
			<p class="rp">Toss batches of the candied pith in the sweet-and-sour mixture. Set the pith slices back on the rack and leave for a few hours or overnight to firm up.</p>
			<p class="rp">If you prefer the rinds a bit chewier, you can leave them in a 200°F oven for about 3 hours, then allow them to cool and harden slightly.</p>
			<p class="rp">The rinds can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks and in the refrigerator up to 1 month.</p>

				<p class="bx">To candy the zest, begin by blanching the zest to remove some of its bitterness. Cover the zest in cold water and bring to a boil. Strain the water and cover again with cold water. You will need to blanch the zest a total of three times. After the final blanch, cover the zest with ½ cup sugar and 1 cup cold water. Bring to a simmer and slowly cook the zest in the syrup, until the zest is tender and sweet, about 20 minutes. Store the zest in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.</p>

			<p class="rt">Sun-Dried Apricot Preserves</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 2 quarts</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IN ARABIC, WE</span> say “bukra fil mish mish,” meaning “when the apricots are in season” to denote when something has little to no chance of happening. A precious staple of the Arab table, we keep an eye out for the few weeks—a very small window of time—when apricots are at their peak ripeness, so we can preserve them for the year ahead.</p>
			<p class="rhn">During peak season in Lebanon, my grandmother used to buy heaping buckets of apricots from her favorite growers, who strapped together their own makeshift farmers’ markets and rolled their carts through the streets—the original farm-to-table entrepreneurs.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The pectin in apricots naturally thickens them into jam when they are heated with sugar. Traditionally, we spread the jam onto trays covered in a thin protective cloth and lay the trays in the sun, where fermentation and evaporation add a layer of complexity and intensify the flavor. If you do not have time for this process, you can skip straight to packing the jam into sterilized jars.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This jam can be laid out very thinly on parchment paper and baked at a low temperature. See the methodology for Dibs Safarjal (<a href="c08.xhtml#page_245">this page</a>), quince paste, to create amardeen, an apricot fruit leather that we dissolve into a nourishing Ramadan drink after a day of fasting to remind ourselves of the richness of life and to jump-start our blood sugar with electrolytes.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This sweet treat serves as an excellent addition to a brunch mezze spread to scoop onto bread with labneh, as a treat all on its own, or spooned up with almonds or hazelnuts.</p>
			<p class="rn"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Note </span>• You will need one 2-quart or two 1-quart wide mouthed Mason jars with lid(s), sterilized.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 pounds apricots, quartered and pitted</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1½ lemons), plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a large pot, toss the apricots, sugar, and lemon juice together and allow to stand for 1 hour. The apricots should begin to release their juices.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat, then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the apricots are soft and falling apart. Stir frequently to prevent the fruit sugars from burning on the bottom. The lemon’s acidity brings out the contrasting tart flavor that makes apricots so irresistible. Taste and add more lemon if your apricots are on the sweeter side.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spread the mixture in a large 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish. Cover with a cheesecloth or dish towel and set the dish in the sun for 2 or 3 days, bringing the pan inside at night to prevent humidity from causing mold.</p>
			<p class="rp">Taste daily. Once the preserve is to your liking, spoon it into the jar or jars and close tightly. The preserve can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244" role="doc-pagebreak" title="244"/>months.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MY MOTHER WOULD</span> often point out this bumpy fruit with its vibrant yellow color, when we passed trees on our trips to Lebanon and Palestine, where they grow abundantly. A distant relative of the pear and apple, quince is super fragrant, like guava, but confusingly, too astringent to eat raw. When activated by heat, the white flesh turns deep red and becomes delicately sweet. The magic is in the cooking. High in pectin content, quince makes a beautiful jam to be eaten with butter and bread on a morning mezze spread.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This is the Arab version of a popular Spanish delicacy called membrillo with a magical ingredient called mastic, otherwise known as Arabic gum, which gives it a subtle note of pine. It makes a good accompaniment to dry, aged cheese.</p>
			<p class="rilf">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons), plus more to prevent browning</p>
			<p class="ril">8 quinces (about 2½ pounds)</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">8 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">2 mastic pods, smashed or ground to a powder (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 2 lemons</p>
			<p class="rpf">Fill a medium bowl with cold water to hold the quinces after they are peeled and cut and add a generous squeeze of lemon.</p>
			<p class="rp">Peel, core, and cut the quinces into 1-inch pieces and place the pieces in the prepared bowl to prevent the fruit from turning brown quickly.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the quinces from the bowl and drain well before tossing with the sugar.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate medium bowl, mix the quinces and sugar and let sit for a couple of hours or overnight, until the liquid releases. This will macerate the fruit and create a cooking liquid for the hard flesh.</p>
			<p class="rp">Crack the cardamom pods, pressing them on a hard surface with the flat side of a knife.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, combine the quince-sugar mixture, cardamom pods, and mastic and cook over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 1 to 1½ hours, until the mixture has developed a deep brick color and becomes very soft. If you have an instant-read thermometer, the mixture should read 220°F. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and zest.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 200°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">Puree the quince mixture in a food processor or blender until smooth. There may be some little bits of black cardamom seeds, so if you’d like, you can press the paste through a fine-mesh sieve to remove them, but I leave mine inside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Set the pan in the oven to dehydrate for 3 hours or until the jam firms into a paste. Remove the pan from the oven and cool at room temperature.</p>
			<p class="rp">Once the quince cools completely, cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. When ready to use, invert the paste onto a cutting board, remove the parchment, and slice into ½-inch slabs.</p>
			<p class="rp">The paste can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246" role="doc-pagebreak" title="246"/>months.</p>
