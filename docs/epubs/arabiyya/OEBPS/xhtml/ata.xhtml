			<p class="fmpf"><span class="upper">REEM ASSIL IS</span> a Palestinian-Syrian entrepreneur based in Oakland, California, and founder of Reem’s California, a nationally acclaimed bakery and restaurant inspired by her passion for Arab street-corner bakeries and the vibrant communities they feed. Reem has garnered an array of top accolades in food, including as a back-to-back James Beard Semifinalist for Best Chef: West (2018/2019), StarChefs’ 2019 San Francisco Rising Star Restaurateur, <span class="i">San Francisco</span> magazine’s 2018 Chef of the Year, and a <span class="i">San Francisco Chronicle</span> 2017 Rising Stars Chef. Reem built her food career at esteemed worker cooperative Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria and is a graduate of the women’s food business incubator program La Cocina, through which she had the privilege of learning from some of the Bay Area’s most notable chefs.</p>
			<p class="p">Prior to her food career, Reem spent more than a decade organizing workers and residents in marginalized communities to have voices on the job and in their neighborhoods. Combining her lifelong experience fighting for justice and twenty years in the nonprofit and food industry, Reem’s current work sits at the intersection of her three passions: Arab hospitality, community building, and social justice.</p>
			<p class="p">Reem chose to write this book with her aunt Emily Katz, who is Jewish. Emily works in nonprofit public interest communications and advocates for social justice. She grew up in rural Northern California, beyond Humboldt County’s electric poles and phone lines, eating the vegetables that her family grew on its homestead and tending the goats and chickens that they raised beneath their cabin.</p>
			<p class="p">The process of book writing was new to them both, but the exercise of self-discovery and reflection was something Reem and Emily had been doing together for most of Reem’s life.</p>
