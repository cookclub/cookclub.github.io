			<p class="fmt">An Arab Tells Her Story</p>
			<p class="fmpf"><span class="upper">I WAS BORN</span> in Waltham, a little town twenty minutes outside of Boston, in the hottest month of the year. Forty-eight hours had gone by since labor pains had interrupted my mother’s birthday picnic beside the cooling breezes of the Charles River, where she had spread a blanket to behold the July Fourth light show. She often pointed out the irony of a birthday greeted each year by the haunting sound of pyrotechnics. A child of war, my mother had fled Gaza, Palestine, in 1967 only to land in the crossfire of an oncoming civil war in Lebanon that would fully erupt several years later. Fire-filled skies were nothing new to her.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Growing up, whenever I put up a fight, she was quick to remind me of her long, hard labor, and that from my very birth, I insisted on doing things on my own terms. Crossing the street as a toddler, she’d tell me I needed to hold her hand. “I’ll hold my own hand,” I would reply, clasping my hands in front of me.</p>
			<p class="fmp">From the time I could sing, I picked up refrains from Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do with It” and Madonna’s “Papa Don’t Preach,” sending ripples of discomfort through my Syrian father and Palestinian mother. From their telling, I never chose the easy way. When I was upset, our entire apartment complex would hear about it. Neighbors reported that my cries could be heard from the McDonald’s parking lot across the street. Sympathetic to the struggles of new parents, they laughingly called me the neighborhood terrorist. It never occurred to my parents to take offense.</p>
			<p class="fmp">My parents started me on toasted pita for teething and garlicky hummus as my first solids. However, my own earliest food memory was not of these Arab staples but rather of eating chocolate cake with my first crush, my neighbor and best friend David. Dressed only in Pampers, we dove into that cake headfirst, bathing ourselves in frosting, sucking fistfuls of the sweet goo from our hands.</p>
			<div class="small_img">
				<img alt="" class="image" id="image_page_1_1" src="../images/013_ASSI_9781984859075_lay_art_r1.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="fmp">One day, after learning that David’s family had moved away, I escaped from our apartment to sob at the foot of his door, where I’d so often gone to find him. Soon after, we, too, would move.</p>
			<p class="fmp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" role="doc-pagebreak" title="2"/>My parents chose Sudbury, a woodsy suburb known for its outstanding schools and its role in the American Revolutionary War. Our home was nestled in the historical footpaths of American legends such as Babe Ruth, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau and served as a perfect staging ground for my magic shows and theatrical performances. In elementary school, I won a starring role as Mary Poppins in the first-grade play and tested my parents’ patience, practicing the songs from the moment I woke in the morning until lights-out at night. It was my dream to broadcast into people’s living rooms like Julie Andrews.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Inside our home, my parents established a strong foundation of Arab culture. But outside, the customs of our well-to-do, largely white town inevitably won out. I learned to code-switch at an early age. While we spoke Arabic at home, we were encouraged to speak only English in school. Early on, my teachers pushed my parents to switch to English, worrying that my reading and writing would fall behind. My sister often joked I switched into my “white voice” on the phone or in the store, when I wanted to blend in: upbeat and high-pitched, demonstrating good vocabulary, and offering a disarming smile, especially when someone pointed out I had a “slight accent.” I learned American idioms such as “the cat’s out of the bag” and tried to use them correctly. Every once in a while, I would mix them up, as in “I can read him like the back of my book.”</p>
			<p class="fmp">I planted a foot in both worlds. One weekend, I’d slip into my Girl Scout vest to sell cookies door-to-door, followed by memorizing verses of the Quran with my father on the way to Sunday school. The next weekend, I’d sneak into parental controls to watch Salt-N-Pepa’s “Let’s Talk about Sex” on MTV and later ride along with my uncles to live orchestral concerts to hear iconic Lebanese musician Marcel Khalife’s brilliant political ballads saluting Palestine.</p>
			<p class="fmp">My food memories are etched with morning bowls of Kix cereal and afternoon snacks of Chips Ahoy! cookies dipped in milk; the only time you’d find me over a stovetop was to boil instant ramen packets and to make Kraft macaroni and cheese from a box. These memories also include long potluck dining tables, extended with desks and folding tables dragged in from other rooms, stacked with olive oil–drenched mezze dips, mountains of rice, cardamom-scented ground meat casseroles, herbed salads, and, inevitably, a box of supermarket cookies added by a family that had run out of time.</p>
			<p class="fmp">By high school, identity began to weigh large. My Arab features and olive skin tone were mistaken for every imaginable ethnic identity—from Indian to Puerto Rican. Though I didn’t develop race consciousness until college, my awareness of racial injustice was born at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. We were but a handful of Brown kids. While I felt uncomfortable being misidentified, I was even more fearful of saying where my family came from. I had few friends and spent lunch, book in hand, nestled into a corner of the cafeteria, lost in a world created by George Orwell and other grimly imagined futures that matched my mood.</p>
			<p class="fmp">My distress was lifted by teachers of color, few though they were, and one lefty Jewish teacher from the Bronx, whose obsession with Jack Kerouac inspired field trips to New York to hit the highlights of the Beat Generation. Taking his lead, I helped organize a trip to the Deep South, visiting places that had changed the course of American history—from Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers had been murdered, to Birmingham, Alabama, where a church bombing by the Ku Klux Klan had killed four young Black girls. Meeting with civil rights activists and hearing their stories helped channel my angst. I learned to question the world and imagine how I, too, might help make another, better world possible.</p>
			<p class="fmp">In each place, I became more enraged at America’s legacy of white supremacy and more inspired by people who put their bodies on the line for nonviolent resistance. I began to make connections between the conditions in Mississippi and Gaza, the Montgomery bus boycott and the Palestinian intifada, and the forced migration of Black folks from the South and my own parents’ migration from Palestine and Syria. I wanted to be like the changemakers who inspired me on that trip.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I set off for college, hoping to solve the issue of “peace in the Middle East.” I felt a new sense of possibility, and I even told my professors that I would become the first Palestinian Muslim woman president. But soon, I recognized a familiar discomfort. Diplomacy, I learned, mostly meant maintaining US influence over the fate of countries like the ones I came from. With anti-Arab fervor erupting following the September 11 attacks my first week of college and with war looming, I fell into a deep despair. I feared for the safety of Arabs both in America and in our homelands. I couldn’t imagine how it might feel to experience justice in the midst of such darkness (and cold Boston winters). I dropped out of school and found my way to sunny California. Like many before me, I fell in love with the Bay Area for its diversity and rich history of social movements. I discovered that you could actually get paid to knock on a door, walk inside, drink some tea, and inspire someone to stand up to a local corporate landlord to lower the rent. To be a part of that transformation was life-changing.</p>
			<p class="fmp">When I was not at work, I was helping transform a decades-old Arab political nonprofit into an organizing hub for working-class Arabs. Through it, I built my own Arab community. We made the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3" role="doc-pagebreak" title="3"/>streets of Oakland and San Francisco our second home, amplifying our power through bullhorns, calling for an end to the US-backed war and occupation of Iraq and building deep alliances with like-minded Black and Brown activist groups. My mother has often jokingly reminded me that when she used to visit, her itinerary often involved locating me at the intersection of a protest march route.</p>
			<p class="fmp">While I honed my skills as an organizer, I also built the kind of community I had always yearned for on a soccer team that proudly called itself anti-imperialist. On the field, I met my husband, an impassioned literacy educator, along with other teachers, artists, cultural workers, and activists, each contributing to social change in their own way. We built up our running skills to evade the police in the city’s anti-war street protests and countered burnout with laughter, dance parties, and mountains of home-cooked food.</p>
			<p class="fmp">For self-care, I built an aptitude for mental calculus and straight-faced trash talk through playing poker. I represented my league at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and dreamed of going pro. And, at the very same time, I fell into Buddhism at Oakland’s first people of color–led Buddhist center.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Yet none of these things, even when put together, fully satisfied me. Throughout my ups and downs, between episodes of burnout and heartache, I gradually recognized that working with food had become a source of emotional, even spiritual, comfort. The sense that food might provide a vehicle to connect me with my life’s purpose grew, and I recognized I needed to find ways to explore it.</p>
			<p class="fmp">So, I left my job as an organizer to see whether life as a baker might nourish my spirit and connect me to my ancestors. I arrived at my first interview at Arizmendi Bakery &amp; Pizzeria—a renowned worker-owned cooperative in the Bay Area—determined <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4" role="doc-pagebreak" title="4"/>to wow them with freshly baked chocolate chip banana muffins and blueberry scones, made just the way I remembered having first tasted them years before at the Cheese Board Collective, their sister bakery in Berkeley. Going to that interview overprepared paid off, and I landed my first bakery job.</p>
			<p class="fmp">On the journey to build the bakery of my dreams, I began the same way many women do in the food business: by taking classes and hustling jobs in catering, bakeries, coffee shops, and bars. Next came pop-ups, which earned me a spot in a women’s restaurant incubator program, La Cocina, an organization that provides low-cost kitchen space, business training, and sisterhood to budding entrepreneurs.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I spent hours in that kitchen working alongside women from every corner of the world: Cambodia, Senegal, Nepal, and Mexico—each day learning a bit more about the resilience that had brought them to this launching pad for women’s food business ownership. I watched in awe as they established ventures that not only expressed their lineage through food but also built wealth for their people. I had an epiphany: my future bakery, Reem’s California, would do more than just tell my peoples’ stories. It would also create good jobs and build community, wherever it found a home.</p>
			<p class="fmp">From La Cocina’s shared commercial kitchen, I opened farmers’ market stalls, where I hauled a saj, a traditional dome-shaped griddle custom-welded for me in the mountains of Lebanon, from market to market. I set out to master mana’eesh, the za’atar-topped bread that was a quintessential street food of my parents’ childhood. Word of our mana’eesh spread, and soon we were selling out at the markets. Long lines and happy eaters attracted media buzz, and a few years later, La Cocina scouted a corner spot for me on a major transit line in Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood, far from the rapidly gentrifying food and yoga clusters farther north. This area was Oakland’s most racially diverse neighborhood. I knew, instantly, I had found the first home for my Arab street corner bakery.</p>
			<p class="fmp"><span class="i">Man’oushe</span>, the Arabic word for a single serving of this bread, derives from the Arabic verb <span class="i">naqasha</span> (<span class="i">na’asha</span> in colloquial Arabic), meaning “to shape, engrave, chisel, indent” or more literally, to stretch out and dimple the dough with your fingertips, creating wells for the spice mix and olive oil to seep into the bread. That act of kneading, rounding, stretching, and shaping dough has brought me joy over the last decade, and that joy is a key part of this cookbook. This book is about not just food but also about the communities and culture that inform it.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I have titled this cookbook <span class="i">Arabiyya</span>, which translates to “Arab woman,” as a declaration of who I am. Claiming my Arab identity in a country where being Arab can get you jailed or, in my experience, make you a magnet for death threats, is a form of resistance. The recipes in this book are recipes for resilience. Many of them center on bread, a longstanding obsession of mine, as the lifeline of Arab history. Eating bread is a sacred communal act. The bread I offer in my recipes is a living thing, borne of yeasts and shaped by our own hands. Reaching into a basket for a warm round pita, ripping off bite-size pieces, and eating with our hands from the same shared plate, we feed our hearts along with our bodies.</p>
			<p class="fmp">This book is an homage to Arab hospitality. In my research, one story emerges again and again: when we encounter strangers, we welcome them into our homes, establish bonds, and even learn from the food practices of our guests. Arab hospitality is how my people have survived desert travel, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5" role="doc-pagebreak" title="5"/>wars, and invasions, and it inspires the dishes I create. That lineage is a beautiful thing, worth tracing and celebrating.</p>
			<p class="fmp">In this book, I refer to my parents’ homeland as the Arab world, which means primarily Arabic-speaking countries, but I also refer to it as Southwest Asia and North Africa (SWANA) rather than the colonial construct of Middle East (middle of whose east? one might ask). SWANA is inclusive of the region’s many ethnic groups who influence the cuisine. Practically speaking, that means the food I serve at my restaurant and the recipes in this book aren’t identifiable as solely Lebanese, Palestinian, or Syrian. So many of our dishes have North African, Armenian, or Ottoman lineage, because all of these countries once made up a single region before colonial forces came in and broke it up. To distinguish the specific region my parents are from, I use Belad al Sham-Arabic for Greater Syria interchangeably with the Levant, a term bestowed by the French when they and the British determined our borders. I admit there are some contradictions and limitations in this language that I’ve not yet solved.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Despite our deep-rooted hospitality, there is friendly competition among Arabs in the region, over whose rendition of a dish is superior, as with the green spice mix za’atar (the name for both the herb and the mix). Some people call the herb that makes it wild thyme; others call it oregano. Jordanians, Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians each claim their za’atar spice mix sets the standard and that others are only imitations. In the end, everyone is right; it’s their truth.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I am not as concerned with the ownership of dishes the way some food writers are but more with sharing the context in which they are eaten and served. Jockeying for ownership, I feel, disconnects the food from its many influences and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6" role="doc-pagebreak" title="6"/>the people who make it. However, in some circumstances, as in our case as Palestinians, claiming (or reclaiming, as I like to call it) ownership of food becomes a tool of resistance. Communities like ours have been invisibilized by the takeover of our foods as a way to cut us off from our lineage. This process is called food theft and is a form of conquest and ethnic cleansing. Where I see it, I always name it.</p>

			<p class="fmp">And finally, this book is a celebration of place; in my case, California. Cooking and sharing food are ways to make a place our home, wherever we may be. In these recipes, I celebrate the resourcefulness and healthful nourishment of Arab cooking, bringing flavors of the homeland to life with the bounty of ingredients available to me. These are proudly “Arab” recipes because they reflect us: vibrant in color and taste, made with fresh local ingredients, and unafraid of bold flavors.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Take this book as an invitation to experience the joy Arab food has brought me. I hope that in sharing my story and my struggles, you will find here inspiration for your own pursuits and nourishment to carry you on your own path. At the very least, every dish can be savored alone, shared with family, or offered as connection with others, as you find your own rhythm in the dance of hospitality.</p>
