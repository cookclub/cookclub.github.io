			<p class="fmt_no"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14" role="doc-pagebreak" title="14"/>Setting Up Your Kitchen</p>
			<p class="pff"><span class="upper">YOU COULD SMELL</span> roasting meats from my grandmother’s oven before you even opened the front door. As we made our way toward the kitchen, the aroma of spices and herbs intensified. Her kitchen was the summer landing pad for our large extended family: all five of my mother’s siblings, along with their spouses and kids. We’d laugh and talk over each other, while my grandmother dashed around the kitchen, jamming snacks onto the middle of the table.</p>
			<p class="p">No spontaneous guest ever caught my grandmother unprepared. When the Northridge earthquake brought the city of Los Angeles to a standstill, a family friend braved the broken freeways and bridges to check up on my grandparents, only to find the garage doors rolled up and my grandmother inside, boiling Arabic coffee on a camping stove and dishing out baklava.</p>
			<p class="p">Many staples of Arab cookery reside in the spice aisles and in the international sections of local grocery chains. In most major cities, Arab grocers carry every ingredient listed here. If no Arab grocer has set up shop in your neighborhood, all the items are a few clicks away at specialty purveyors, who source excellent single-origin products. See <a href="bm2.xhtml#page_286">this page</a> for my favorite spice and specialty ingredient suppliers. I recommend substitutes as well, so you can improvise with the ingredients you have on hand.</p>
			<p class="p">I’ve organized these lists to match my own kitchen. Through my restaurant experience and the years spent learning about my cuisine, I’ve become comfortable using the ingredients and tools I used to ignore in my childhood kitchen.</p>
			<p class="p">Stocking your kitchen with the ingredients in this section will ensure you’ll be ready to cook from this cookbook and whip up Arab flavors at a moment’s notice.</p>
			<p class="h1" id="page_14a">THE ESSENTIAL PANTRY</p>
			<p class="pf">We always joked that my mother stocked her pantry as if we were preparing for the apocalypse. After the 2020 pandemic, that doesn’t seem so farfetched. I like to bulk up on the following items since they are shelf stable.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_14b">Canned Tomatoes</p>
			<p class="pf">Many veggie and meat recipes call for tomatoes stewed down to a sauce. Both fresh and canned work well. I keep canned San Marzano tomatoes on hand for their balance of sweetness and acidity.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_14c">Grains</p>
			<p class="pf">Arabs mostly use long-grain basmati rice to accompany one-pot stews, but for stuffing, we go for medium-grained jasmine or short-grained Arborio rice that creates a nice absorbent filling. Stock up on fine bulgur for many of the dishes in this book; it’s usually labeled bulgur #1. The darker it is, the less refined and the more nutritious. Other specialty grains included are freekeh, cracked green wheat with a smoky flavor, and maftool, a large Palestinian couscous made from bulgur or from a wheat and bulgur mixture.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15" role="doc-pagebreak" title="15"/>Flower Waters</p>
			<p class="pf">Orange blossom water and rose water douse all manner of Arab sweets with blossomy springtime no matter the time of year. These floral essences are available at many chain grocery stores, but if you are unable to find them, make your own by submerging fresh orange blossoms or rose petals in a saucepan with water, just enough to cover, and bring to a simmer. Then cook at the lowest setting for 15 minutes; cool completely before straining and bottling. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_15a">Legumes</p>
			<p class="pf">I use both dried and canned beans. When I have time for a presoak, dried beans produce a better product, but let’s face it, it can often be hard to think a day ahead. If you are blessed to have an Instant Pot, dried beans can go straight into it. I keep the basics on hand: chickpeas and a varietal of fava bean called ful madammas, which is also a mezze staple (see <a href="c05.xhtml#page_151">this page</a>). I also keep lentils, both brown and red, on hand; these are integral to Arab cuisine.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_15b">Molasses</p>
			<p class="pf">Arabs use a variety of fruity molasses to sweeten drinks, swirl into tahini to scoop with bread on the mezze breakfast table, or even in meat marinades. I mostly use pomegranate molasses. It complements both bright flavors and darker warming spices beautifully. If you cannot find it at your Arab grocery store or on the specialty shelf in your local grocery store, it’s simple to make. Just cook down any available pomegranate juice on a low simmer, until it’s reduced to a quarter of its volume. It should be thick to the touch and heavily coat your spoon.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_15c">Nuts</p>
			<p class="pf">I keep shelled pistachios, walnuts, almonds, and pine nuts on hand for both savory and sweet dishes. Pistachios from the Arab world are far different from the ones you will find at a conventional grocery store. They have a brighter green color and a slightly sweet, edible purplish cover with an earthy tone. If you have access to a local international store, it is worth the investment to buy from small-scale regional producers. You can also get pistachios roasted in the shells for snacking. All nuts will keep better in resealable bags in the refrigerator or freezer if you can spare the room.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_15d">Oils</p>
			<p class="pf">For Arab cooking, I stock neutral oils such as canola, sunflower, or grapeseed for frying and roasting along with richer varieties of olive oils for mixing, drizzling, and everything else.</p>
			<p class="p">Oil used for frying can be strained back into a clean jar, cooled, and then refrigerated for several more uses. Once your oil is a deep dark golden color or acquires a bitter metallic aroma, it can be recycled or thrown away.</p>
			<p class="p">To make the recipes in this book, you’ll need ample olive oil on hand. In Arab cooking, olive oil is an ingredient unto itself and is not simply a function of food preparation. A generous moat of olive oil tops hummus and most of the mezze dishes in our cuisine. My son slurps olive oil by the spoonful. It’s one of the ways I know he’s Palestinian. Never pass up locally pressed oil if it crosses your path. If it’s pricey, it’s probably worth it. When it comes to olive oil, cheaper is almost never better.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_15e">Tahini</p>
			<p class="pf">Tahini translates to ground sesame; its seeds provide the most ancient source of cooking oil known to humanity, and its creamy nuttiness forms the base for many of our dishes. I prefer a lighter-color tahini, made from hulled seeds, and brands that stir more easily since solids settle, making it harder to reincorporate them. A darker-color tahini, made from unrefined seeds, is a little more bitter. It’s worth your time to sample a few small jars to discover the differences and to find your favorite.</p>
			<div class="full_none">
				<img alt="" class="image" src="../images/5.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16" role="doc-pagebreak" title="16"/>Salt</p>
			<p class="pf">I use two types of salt: kosher for cooking and flakes of coarser sea salt to top finished dishes. Diamond Crystal kosher salt comes in a three-pound box. I prefer it to Morton’s, which is twice as salty. Yes, the same measure is actually double the salinity. If you’re using anything other than Diamond Crystal for the recipes in this book, reduce the salt by half and adjust to taste from there. Kosher salts simply mean the crystals are larger. I like the way they rub onto meats. Kosher salts take a little longer to dissolve, so stir your dish between pinches when you’re adding salt.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_16a">Shatta</p>
			<p class="pf">THE hot sauce of the Arab world, this fermented red chile paste takes just about any savory dish to the next level. There are a variety of brands available at Arab groceries; I like mine with garlic. Homemade hot chile paste goes a long way, so if you feel inspired, see Shatta (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_44">this page</a>). Vietnamese chile garlic sauce makes a comparable substitute.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_16b">Vinegars</p>
			<p class="pf">I keep vinegars on hand for pickling and salad dressings. My go-to staples are apple cider and white balsamic or champagne vinegars for a touch of sweetness.</p>
			<p class="h1" id="page_16c">SPICES</p>
			<p class="pf">Nothing is more Arab than a kitchen with spice-scented cabinets. Over the years, layer upon layer of spices seep into the wood, leaving a scented trail to the kitchen’s history. As a kid, the smell of our cabinets filled me with an embarrassment I couldn’t name, but with three thousand miles between me and my mom’s cooking, just a whiff of the pantry in the homes of Arab friends sends ripples of nostalgia through my body. You’ll need a LOT of spices for Arab cooking. Buying spices whole, toasting them, and powdering them in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle is a game changer. They not only will taste richer but will also stay fresher a lot longer.</p>
			<p class="p">See <a href="part1b.xhtml#page_20">this page</a> for a breakdown of spices I stock in my cupboard and some work-around suggestions in case you don’t have these spices on hand. Two spice mixes, Saba’a Baharat (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>) and Khalta Harra (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>) scaffold most of my meats and stews with warm, earthy notes. Making small batches to have on hand accelerates the cooking process. Spice mixes will keep fresh for months in resealable bags or in airtight containers in the freezer.</p>
			<p class="h1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17" role="doc-pagebreak" title="17"/>VEGGIES AND HERBS</p>
			<p class="pf">Having fresh herbs, chiles, and flavor builders on hand gives a dazzling bump to mezze, main dishes, stews, and salads—just about any savory dish in Arab cuisine. My grandmother used to wrap her herbs and chiles in paper towels and newspaper and then tuck the bundles in the vegetable drawer in the refrigerator to keep them fresh longer. When herbs start to wilt, you can also wrap and freeze them for later use.</p>
			<p class="p">Below is a list of my go-to veggies and herbs.</p>

			<p class="h1" id="page_17a">DAIRY</p>
			<p class="pf">Arab cuisine, breakfasts and pastries in particular, is rich in fermented dairy, boosting microorganisms that aid digestion. These staples, which I’ve listed below, were always in the refrigerators of my mother and grandmother. They can be added to any breakfast or snack and will make possible numerous dishes in this book, without having to make an extra trip to the store.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_17b">Akkawi Cheese</p>
			<p class="pf">A salty, brined cow’s cheese from the eponymous coastal city of Akka (which appears on maps today as Acre). Akkawi is eaten fresh with fruits and vegetables, crumbled over Mana’eesh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_77">this page</a>), and, most famously, desalinated in a water bath and melted into Knafeh (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_265">this page</a>), a phyllo-crusted sweet cheese dessert.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_17c">Feta Cheese</p>
			<p class="pf">I take a page from my grandmother and go for the creamier Bulgarian or French sheep’s milk feta cheese.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_17d">Halloum</p>
			<p class="pf">A little harder than Akkawi, Halloum (Arabic for Halloumi cheese) keeps for months unopened and is great to have on hand to fry up for breakfast and serve with scrambled eggs or to sprinkle over salads.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_17e">Labneh</p>
			<p class="pf">This was a go-to staple in my pantry while growing up. Thicker, tangier, and more complex than your average Greek yogurt, labneh results from the simple process of removing whey from yogurt. The more whey that is removed, the thicker and richer it gets. My grandmother used to strain it to the point of a goat cheese consistency, roll it into balls, and preserve them in oil. Many stores now sell labneh. You can either purchase it or make your own at home. To make at home: For every cup of whole milk yogurt, mix in ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt, then scrape the yogurt into a fine cheesecloth, tied tightly and suspended over a sink or bowl; drain overnight. My mom used to hang it outside for our neighbor’s dog to lap up the whey drippings.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18" role="doc-pagebreak" title="18"/>Samneh</p>
			<p class="pf">Samneh is clarified butter. You can make your own (see <a href="c04.xhtml#page_96">this page</a>) or buy ghee (the two are interchangeable). Why bother to clarify butter? Without its milk solids, samneh’s burn point is a hundred degrees higher, allowing your pastries to brown beautifully without burning.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18a">Whole Milk Yogurt</p>
			<p class="pf">Whole milk yogurt is essential for making labneh, to use as the base for savory hot dishes, and to serve as a cold accompaniment to rice dishes.</p>
			<p class="h1" id="page_18b">FREEZER</p>
			<p class="pf">I love storing premade stocks, dough, and meats to get a head start on many of the recipes in this book. Freezing baked pita bread and pastries to revive at a moment’s notice is also another crafty way to impress guests with little effort. The following additional items are the main ingredients I keep on hand for hosting.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18c">Coffee Beans</p>
			<p class="pf">Freezing coffee is the best way to preserve the flavor and integrity of the beans, and I grind mine right before brewing. However, I often get Arabic (or Turkish, as many places call it) coffee preground to the fineness it needs to be to execute a perfect boiled pot. I freeze those grounds as well. If your beans are whole, you’ll need a very fine grind similar to that of an espresso to make Ahwa Arabi (<a href="c10.xhtml#page_275">this page</a>).</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18d">Nut and Seed Mixes</p>
			<p class="pf">My grandmother packed her freezer to the brim with varied mixes of nuts and seeds. Her favorite was roasted watermelon seeds. Since nuts and seeds do go rancid, freezing is a surefire way to preserve the freshness of your snacks for hikes and day trips.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18e">Phyllo Dough</p>
			<p class="pf">Phyllo’s thin sheets store easily in the freezer to use for beautifully layered sweets or savory wraps to impress family and guests alike. A good phyllo is the perfect balance between a strong dough and delicate texture.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18f">Shredded Phyllo Dough</p>
			<p class="pf">Shredded phyllo dough, sometimes named kataifi, is the key ingredient for Knafeh (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_265">this page</a>). If you are planning to wow guests with this quintessential Palestinian delicacy, make sure to have shredded phyllo on hand.</p>
			<p class="h1" id="page_18g">TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT</p>
			<p class="pf">It won’t break the bank to have the tools you need to cook like an Arab. These are eight tools I’ve come to rely on, especially for bread making, spice prep, and coffee.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_18h">Bench and Bowl Scrapers</p>
			<p class="pf">These flat rectangular scrapers come in handy when making breads and sweet pastries in many of the recipes in this book. Mine are always within reach. Gripped across the top, they make scooping out batters and cutting dough easier, functioning like an extension of your hand. You can purchase these at any well-stocked kitchen store or online.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18i" role="doc-pagebreak" title="18i"/>Digital Scale</p>
			<p class="pf">Many of my recipes were converted to a volume suitable for home cooking. This took some doing, since it required that I shift from my professional cook mindset of precision and production to the right balance of deliciousness and ease for home cooking. Most of the baking recipes in this book include both volume and weight measurements, so there will be no doubt in your mind what I mean when I call for a cup of flour, which can vary in weight. Scales are affordable and can be purchased at most homeware stores or ordered online.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19" role="doc-pagebreak" title="19"/>Ice Cream Scoops</p>
			<p class="pf">When I took up baking, I found myself purchasing different-size scoops to evenly portion batters and cookie dough without getting my hands all sticky. I have suggested a scoop for many recipes in this book. I recommend a two-ounce scoop with a release mechanism for its rounded ball shape and its ease of use.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_19a">Pizza Tools</p>
			<p class="pf">Technically, this cookbook has no pizzas. However, the flatbreads synonymous with Arab cuisine require a high-heat hearth just like a pizza oven, and that’s where specialty tools can give home ovens an extra edge. Investing in a pizza peel (a shovel-like tool to slide large flatbreads in and out of the oven) and a flat pizza stone can replicate the effect of a professional oven. There is nothing like Mana’eesh (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_77">this page</a>) with beautifully browned crusts. I also invested in a wheel-shaped pizza cutter to divide my flatbreads into pieces for sharing without displacing the toppings.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_19b">Rakweh</p>
			<p class="pf">A rakweh doesn’t have a direct translation in English, but it refers to a distinctive copper pitcher used to make Arabic coffee. Growing up, the rakweh had a specially reserved spot on our stove, awaiting spoons of Arabic coffee that were then boiled into a rich espresso-like drink (see <a href="c10.xhtml#page_275">this page</a>). But the pot isn’t used only for coffee. A stainless-steel version, called a Turkish warmer, available at Bed Bath and Beyond, costs less than $10. It’s a perfect no-spill, dishwasher-friendly pot for whipping up small batches of sauce, reducing gravy, melting chocolate, making Attar (<a href="c04.xhtml#page_97">this page</a>), toasting seeds, or steeping tea. Its tapered shape helps brings a small volume of liquid to a boil, minimizing the splatter that causes burns. I believe my mother would approve of this hack.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_19c">Rolling Pin and Dowel</p>
			<p class="pf">In the bread chapter, you will be rolling out a lot of dough. I prefer a French rolling pin with its tapered edges for easier control. To make the turnovers, a dowel comes in handy for rolling those smaller pieces of dough. These dowels can be found, for just a few dollars, in Asian specialty stores, since they are an essential tool for making dumplings.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_19d">Spice or Coffee Grinder</p>
			<p class="pf">In Arab cooking, you nail the flavors by preserving their quality. For as little as $15 or $20, a little electric grinder will maximize the flavors of the food you cook. Buying spices whole and then roasting and grinding them a little at a time preserves their pungency. I offer a few key spice recipes you can premix to have on hand, but it takes less than three minutes to warm a pan and dry-roast single spices. This releases the aromatic oils before grinding and increases their intensity. A spice grinder can also double as a coffee bean grinder. If you’re using one device for both purposes, grind and discard a tablespoon of rice between uses.</p>
			<p class="h2" id="page_19e">Instant-Read Thermometer</p>
			<p class="pf">You can take out some of the guesswork in the baking and sweets recipes by using a $15 instant-read thermometer online or at a kitchen supply store.</p>
