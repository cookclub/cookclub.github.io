			<p class="fmpf"><span class="upper">EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL</span>—including food.</p>
			<p class="fmp">The recipes that get handed down to us, from generation to generation, are like treasure maps and time capsules all at once. They are treasure maps because they help us find our way through roadblocks (can I substitute butter for lard?), crossroads (what happens if I put this appetizer with this main course?), and obstacle courses (can I get this done before my guests arrive?). When the food is on the table, we celebrate a sense of accomplishment for having navigated our way to the treasure, which is (hopefully) a delicious meal that puts a smile on everyone’s face.</p>
			<p class="fmp">Recipes are also time capsules—they show us the ways in which those before us navigated the conditions of their lives and persevered. In my own cultural traditions, our recipes consist of the foods that were available to us, due to our social and economic status. Racism often meant that foods that were available to those in power were not available to those of us who were not. Still, we learned how to navigate these roadblocks both because of and in spite of them.</p>
			<p class="fmp">The traditional staples of my family were not as widely celebrated as they are now. Sometimes, the food you eat is a telltale sign of your social, economic, and political standing. The kale and collard greens that are so popular today were once rations that were given to enslaved people. My people learned to make these tough, leafy greens tender and delicious. Yams, sweet potatoes, and other starches were also a part of this basic diet, mostly formed from rations under enslavement. We have taken devastating times and found ways to persist, and that struggle is reflected in our food.</p>
			<p class="fmp">My best friend and I met over food—she, native Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, and white, and me, Black, in a mixed family, in a high school that was predominantly white. We shared a class—geometry—which neither one of us was particularly good at. Our teacher was an aging hippie with an excellent mustache who didn’t believe that rows of desks provided the best learning environment, and so we sat at round tables. She and I found each other at one of those round tables, alongside another friend who was also a student of color. Every week we sat together, sharing food from our homes. I would bring fried chicken, creamed corn, greens with ham hocks, and cornbread. She would bring kalua pig and taro, or that delicious blackberry peach cobbler that her mama made that involved hours of picking blackberries across the street from their home. Our other seatmate brought food from the school cafeteria where he worked—french fries, nachos, pizza, and any candy we wanted—and we would put everything in the middle and share equally.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I looked forward to our gatherings each week. Our little round table was defiant—we were definitely more interested in what we were eating than what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_vii" role="doc-pagebreak" title="vii"/>we were learning about shapes in space, but more than that, we’d found commonality in our differences. Through those meals, we shared our differences as well as the things we had in common. And we learned about each other through our weekly geometry banquets, which showed me the power of food to connect.</p>
			<p class="fmp">I met Reem more than a decade ago, through our organizing work. She did work specializing in building strategic partnerships between labor organizations and community-based organizations. I was working in San Francisco, at an organization fighting gentrification and displacement. Where I saw Reem really find her voice, however, was at the intersection of food and community. When she opened a bakery just a few blocks from my home, I marveled at the way in which she matched community values in front of and behind the counter. I knew that Reem employed local residents, many of whom were systems impacted or formerly incarcerated, and of color. Around her kitchen buzzed women, Black people, and people of color; immigrants, gender-non-conforming people, and queer people. I knew that Reem paid a living wage and offered generous benefits, and that she aimed to interrupt the ways in which our food industries dehumanize people. That’s how I know that like everything, food is also political.</p>
			<p class="fmp">It was also political when Reem’s restaurant was attacked for a mural displaying a Palestinian activist, Rasmea Odeh. I hadn’t seen Reem in years, my own life having changed dramatically with the emergence of a resurgence of the Black freedom movement led by Black Lives Matter. But on one of my few days not spent on an airplane, my partner and I went to visit. There was Reem, bouncing a new baby on her hip, visiting tables in a beautifully vibrant location with bright colors. A few weeks after visiting, I heard that the bakery was being attacked in an attempt to put it at the center of conservative political rhetoric about Palestine and Palestinians—all because of the mural that greeted you when you arrived at the bakery. A mural of a Palestinian woman, who had been attacked, tortured, and demeaned for daring to be free, for daring to even assert that Palestine <span class="i">exists</span>. I knew that Reem was Syrian and Palestinian, that her family had fled war. I knew that Reem herself and her family had endured slurs of “terrorist” and things much worse than that, simply because of the region that she hailed from. I showed up then for Reem because she is my friend, because I know her work, and I know her heart. I showed up for Reem to support her business and keep her in business—and in the process I learned more about her culture, her history, and her story.</p>
			<p class="fmp">With food, we find one another again. We learn our stories, get a window into our history and our present, and learn about how we have been resilient together in the face of unequal power. Perhaps these discoveries come from the few kids of color meeting over a round table in geometry class, or a Syrian Palestinian woman finding herself and home in food. The politics inherent to food can not only divide us, but also bring us together.</p>
