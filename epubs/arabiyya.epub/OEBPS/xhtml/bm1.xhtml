			<p class="fmt">Arab Hospitality Is Not for Sale</p>
			<p class="bmpf"><span class="upper">IN THE SUMMER</span> of 2018, I touched down in Aspen, Colorado, on a small jet packed with culinary celebrities whose accomplishments I had followed for years. I was about to showcase my cuisine at the Food &amp; Wine Classic, a destination for the highest echelon of fine dining. In the wake of a vicious political backlash I’d experienced the year prior, Reem’s had been named one of the Top 10 New Restaurants by <span class="i">Food &amp; Wine</span> magazine, which is based in Birmingham, Alabama—not exactly a hotbed of radicalism.</p>
			<p class="bmp">Despite the thrill of being honored, I hadn’t wanted to go. With a three-month-old baby in tow, I was exhausted and miserable with raging postpartum depression. Still, an old, familiar doubt kept nagging at me, insisting that this might be my only shot; I might never be invited again. And so, I decided to go.</p>
			<p class="bmp">By the time I entered the showroom, my heart was racing with worry that my food would not be good enough for people who’d paid thousands of dollars for entry. My mouth turned dry at the thought of what I might say to people, many of them white and rich and with whom I felt I had little in common. Would they even know where Oakland was on a map? How would they react when I say the word <span class="i">Arab</span> to describe my food?</p>
			<p class="bmp">The first guest to my table picked up a round of my hot grilled flatbread, spread with muhammara and sprinkled with arugula, and she immediately asked whether it was red pepper hummus. Before I could even form my words, she grabbed another plate, raving about it, and then walked away. Learning about Arab food traditions was not on her agenda.</p>
			<p class="bmp">It had been a long time since I’d been tempted to hold my tongue just to get through an uncomfortable event, but there I was, a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef West with a dozen other accolades behind my name worrying that I was underserving. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this attention had been staged by media, hungry for a rags-to-riches story to prove that even a Brown girl like me could make it in the food world.</p>
			<p class="bmp">I had worked hard to bring the different parts of myself together at Reem’s. Although the press had called my rise meteoric, I had never felt so fragmented. Was I becoming a sellout? Could I afford to say “No” to the stream of invitations arriving each month? Despite my misgivings, I kept accepting one uncompensated gig after another, hoping these opportunities would further my career. So, when Daniel Patterson, a Michelin-starred chef, offered me a waterfront restaurant partnership with no financial strings attached, it was hard to say “No.” After all, I had a family to feed, and I’d put everything on the line for my bakery—every cent I’d hustled at farmers’ markets, the thousands of hard-earned dollars I’d borrowed from friends and family, and the loans I’d taken from the only organizations that would lend to a first-time restaurateur. Even with all of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_284" role="doc-pagebreak" title="284"/>that, it still wasn’t enough to make ends meet in my single-income family.</p>
			<p class="bmp">After a series of meetings, it became official: Daniel would handle the capital and the back end of the business, and I would help him launch a restaurant called Dyafa, the Arabic word for “hospitality,” and introduce my vision for Arab food and culture to Bay Area fine dining.</p>
			<p class="bmp">Daniel had built a reputation for collaborations to boost chefs of color like me, who had come from outside the mainstream of the American culinary establishment. He clearly must not have Googled me since I caught him by surprise when I asked if he considered the backlash against me a liability. He said he did not. Instead, he expressed solidarity with Palestinians. I suddenly felt more at ease.</p>
			<p class="bmp">Since I couldn’t afford a maternity leave, only two weeks after my child was born, I launched a busy restaurant, leaving me no time to recuperate. In the subtext, however, the hardest challenge came not from external forces but from within. Increasingly, my brain space was taken up figuring out the power dynamics in my new partnership. It turns out, the subtext is everything.</p>
			<p class="bmp">It was not uncommon for customers to approach me at Dyafa and ask to meet the chef. I was, of course, not the person they had imagined. I tried to get comfortable in my role, but I found myself beholden to standards and etiquette I’d had no part in shaping and little power to change. I did not know how to sharpen my knife correctly or fold my hand towels properly. I didn’t even like being called “the chef.” In this setting, being chef meant I could walk in and say, “This sauce has to be changed.” But my organizer self knew that it was the training and the systems that went into making the sauce that needed changing. The democratic values I had manifested for my bakery seemed to be going nowhere. Even the food itself seemed to be getting away from me. When I was told my musakhan was too one-note, I could feel the blood rushing to my face, my feet tingling. Musakhan, a sweet and sour onion-sumac umami wonder, was our best-seller at Reem’s. I knew better.</p>
			<p class="bmp">The headlines had turned me into a protégé, a chef whose cuisine was being “elevated,” when I knew that Arab food needed no elevating. At Reem’s, creating recipes with different twists had always brought me joy, but at Dyafa, as I watched my own personal recipes—those of my ancestors—undergo adaptation through a European aesthetic, it did the opposite. I realized that Arab hospitality could not be subcontracted.</p>
			<p class="bmp">Hitching my star to Daniel’s had seemed like being handed the keys to the kingdom, but now, it was that very kingdom I wanted to overthrow. Its founding myth was one I had internalized, despite my training and beliefs: that wealth equals knowledge, and an accomplished white male chef knows secrets about running a successful restaurant that I didn’t. It wasn’t long before my doubts caught up with reality.</p>
			<p class="bmp">I came to understand that serving as a figurehead, without any real power, was turning me into a token. I knew I needed to return to the fringes, where, yes, I‘d find fewer dollars but also more support. So I decided to leave the partnership and invest directly in myself and in my employees.</p>
			<p class="bmp">By the time I opened my third restaurant, in March of 2020, I had enough experience behind me to know what really mattered. I’d learned to inspire employees around my values, and I had built a dedicated, cross-trained, mission-oriented team. I’d opened one restaurant to death threats and another through an ill-fated partnership. I felt ready to open a bakery on my own terms, in San Francisco’s Mission District, in the very same neighborhood where we had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_285" role="doc-pagebreak" title="285"/>launched our first farmers’ market stand five years earlier.</p>
			<p class="bmp">But on opening day, I found myself holed up in the bunkerlike basement of my restaurant, flipping through an order from the mayor, reading the term <span class="i">social distancing</span> for the first time. With bills mounting, payroll looming, and new debt, I wondered how I could stay open. But also, I wondered, how could I afford to close? Later that same afternoon, the governor issued shelter-in-place orders and mandated the closure of all restaurants.</p>
			<p class="bmp">The next day, I lay in bed, feeling once again that it was all over. Maybe it was not possible, after all, to revolutionize the food system. Maybe the time had come to shutter my doors and walk away.</p>
			<p class="bmp">The fourth night of the shutdown marked a watershed moment in my experience as an organizer and business owner. My employees summoned their courage and sent me a letter demanding answers. I had none. What would be my plan? And what would become of them? The prospect of failing my workers felt devastating, but their collective action also inspired me.</p>
			<p class="bmp">Grief has a way of clarifying purpose and values. I did not start Reem’s to own a restaurant but rather to build a transformative space, where everyone has a voice; for my employees, my customers, my community, and, not least of all, for myself. I did it to build a strong, resilient community, using the foods of my heritage as a tool. On a perfect day, I would walk through my kitchen and see Nino, who could only speak Tagalog when he first joined Reem’s, patiently teaching Angela, newly arrived from El Salvador with no kitchen experience, solid knife skills. I would taste Mariana’s Oaxacan mole, prepared for a staff meal, and see her face light up at my suggestion that one day, she, too, could have her own restaurant. I would hear Armando’s hysterical laugh from the back as he danced to cumbia, while doing the day’s inventory. Reem’s is made up of all of my team members’ rich experience and knowledge. Their talent and dedication are the real secrets behind our success; they are the very heart of Reem’s. So, I knew I could not walk away from them; I had to stay and fight.</p>
			<p class="bmp">The pandemic of 2020 presented an opportunity for reinvention. It gave us a test kitchen to try out new models for a liberatory food system, one in which everyone’s dreams are fed.</p>
			<p class="bmp">In the enterprise I envision, all workers’ knowledge, experience, and cultures are assets, and each is equipped with the tools and confidence to build wealth. Together, we can heal and build the world we dream of, where each one of us can live a life with love, dignity, and self-determination.</p>
			<p class="bmp">If the pandemic has taught me anything, it’s that we have the power to care for and protect one another. It turns out, we’ve had that power all along. By tapping into the wisdom of our ancestors and taking lessons from the land, we can build the resilience to thrive in even the hardest times. While change is inevitable, one thing remains true: no matter what happens next, Arab hospitality is not for sale.</p>
