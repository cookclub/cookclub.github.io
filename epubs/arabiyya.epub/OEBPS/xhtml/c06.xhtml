			<p class="rt">Spiced Rice with Fried Vermicelli</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">FOUR THINGS SET</span> Arab rice apart from all others: first, the confetti of toasty golden vermicelli noodle threads wrapped between white grains of rice; second, the sweetness of spices; third, the textural crunch of roasted almond slivers; and fourth, the bright visual contrast of forest green parsley.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mom used to make this dish in huge mounds, topped with fried nuts, spiced ground meat, and parsley for dramatic effect. With the addition of the meat, it could make a main dish, although it rarely stands alone in Arab homes. This is feast food, whether around the family dinner table, at a wedding, a potluck, or anywhere in between.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My mom always had a stash of vermicelli from the Arab grocer in her pantry, dried into little fist-size nests, perfectly portioned to crush single-handedly into warm oil in the bottom of the rice pot. The thin noodles also come already fragmented, or you can break noodles from a supermarket box of vermicelli. All sources work equally well.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Cooking rice is as much an art in the Arab world as it is in every rice-eating culture. To produce loose, individual grains that roll off each other instead of sticking, ensure every morsel is coated in oil before adding water.</p>
			<p class="rilf"><span class="frac">¼</span> cup neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup Italian vermicelli (semolina based), broken into small fragments no larger than 1 inch (angel hair pasta makes a fine substitute)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup basmati rice, rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup fried or toasted slivered almonds or pine nuts</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Once the oil is warm, fry the vermicelli a minute or two until golden. Add the rice, stir to coat, and fry, stirring frequently until the rice smells toasty, about 3 minutes. Add the spice mix, salt, and water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn down the heat to the lowest setting, cover the pot, and continue cooking, until all the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Do not to stir in the meantime—something I’m always tempted to do.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fluff the rice with a fork and serve on a platter topped with the nuts and parsley. Serve alongside a main dish or use as a stuffing for poultry or vegetables.</p>
			<p class="rp">The rice can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>

			<p class="rt">Onion-Studded Lentil and Rice Pilaf</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">THIS LENTIL AND</span> rice dish is delicious, deeply satisfying, and easy to pull together. It’s ironic to see this subsistence staple fancified on restaurant menus.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Although my family never used turmeric in this dish, I learned to love it made this way. Its musky hint gives the dish a biryani feel. Traditionally, the rice and lentils together are soft—even softer than rice alone. For more texture, I top mine with crunchy things such as seeds or nuts. Together with the Khyar bil Laban (<a href="c07.xhtml#page_218">this page</a>), a yogurt-mint salad, it’s a quick and incredibly satisfying meal in a bowl.</p>
			<p class="rilf">⅔ cup brown lentils, rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling the onions</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups thinly sliced onions (about 1 large onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup basmati rice, rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground coriander</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
			<p class="ril">Whole milk yogurt for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium pot, immerse the lentils in water, about an inch above the lentils. Dissolve the salt in the water and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to simmer and cook, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the lentils are al dente—soft outside and slightly firm in the center. Strain and reserve the liquid.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the lentils are cooking, warm ¼ cup of the oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add 1 cup of the onions and fry to a deep golden brown, stirring more frequently toward the end. The onions should be soft in the center, crispy at the tips, and deep brown in color. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Set the finished onions aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, warm the remaining ¼ cup oil over medium heat and sweat the remaining 1½ cups onions until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat. Sauté the rice in the onion-oil mixture for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the cumin, coriander, allspice, and turmeric. Pour in 1½ cups of the reserved lentil water (if your lentils did not yield enough liquid, add water to make up the difference). Bring to a boil, cover, and turn down the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes. When most of the water has been absorbed, fold in the lentils, cover, and cook for 5 minutes more.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, spoon onto a serving platter and top with the fried onions.</p>
			<p class="rp">The pilaf can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">EVERY CULTURE HAS</span> a version of chicken soup, and ours has many. The one I love best is my mother’s freekeh soup, a creamy porridgelike chicken stew made with cracked wheat, cooked to a risotto-like consistency in classic Arab spices. Beyond the warming spices of the chicken stock, this soup is unique for its freekeh, a green durum wheat, fire-roasted and smoky. I love the chewiness of freekeh, which turns soups into savory porridge.</p>
			<p class="rilf">2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</p>
			<p class="ril">4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning the chicken skins</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups medium-diced onions (about 1 onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ tablespoons minced garlic (about 6 cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">5 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">6 cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup freekeh, rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="ril">1 lemon, cut into wedges</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Season the chicken with 2 teaspoons of the salt. Warm the olive oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the skin crisps and turns dark golden brown and the fat from the bird releases into the cooking oil. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the same pot, add the onions, garlic, and ginger and sauté for 5 minutes or until the onions are translucent. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, spice mix, and cardamom pods, sautéing until fragrant. Return the chicken to the pot, add the water and bay leaf, and bring to a boil. Skim and discard any foam from the surface. Turn down the heat to simmer, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through but not falling apart. Remove the chicken from the stock and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the chicken is cooking, stir the freekeh into the cooking stock and return to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, for 25 minutes. The soup should thicken, and the freekeh should be tender.</p>
			<p class="rp">When the meat is cool enough to handle, pull it from the bones and reserve the skins. Place the skins on a paper towel to pat dry, then chop into ¼-inch pieces. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Tear the chicken into bite-size pieces, about the width of your forefinger. I often save the bones to make a second broth for other uses. Return the chicken pieces to the pot and keep on low heat until ready to serve.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small pan on high heat, add the neutral oil and fry the chicken skins until crispy. Set aside on paper towels to drain and season generously with salt.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, remove the cardamom pods and bay leaf. Spoon the freekeh into bowls, crumble the crispy chicken skins over the tops, and add a squeeze of fresh lemon along with the parsley.</p>
			<p class="rp">The freekeh can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169" role="doc-pagebreak" title="169"/>months.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MAKING THIS DISH</span> reminds me of my grandmother and my connection to family around the world. Every summer, my mother, sisters, and I would visit my grandparents’ home in the San Fernando Valley of California—along with our extended family, who came all the way from Greece and the Arab Gulf. The festivities always commenced with a pool party, followed by stuffed Cornish hens for lunch. The rich, meaty stuffing, perfumed with cinnamon, allspice, and pine nuts, was the perfect match for the spice-rubbed birds.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Dry-brining—which is a fancy way of saying seasoning in advance—is an important step. It tenderizes and enhances the overall flavor of the otherwise mild chicken, while speeding up the browning process on the exterior, giving it a perfectly crispy skin. If you are short on time, you can let your seasoned chicken sit at room temperature for an hour before baking.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">One 3- to 4-pound chicken</p>
			<p class="rilh">Stuffing</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 yellow onion, finely diced</p>
			<p class="ril">10 ounces ground lamb or beef</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ teaspoons Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground turmeric</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</p>
			<p class="ril">1¾ cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup pine nuts or slivered almonds, toasted, plus ¼ cup for garnish</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup fresh dill (optional) for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a small bowl, combine the salt, spice mix, and sumac and rub it all over the chicken, both inside and out. Let the chicken sit, uncovered, in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for an hour.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the stuffing: Put the rice in a medium bowl, cover with cold water, and let it soak for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a large pot over medium heat, warm the ¼ cup olive oil until it shimmers, then add the onions and sauté for about 5 minutes until translucent; don’t let them brown. Add the ground meat, spice mix, turmeric, black pepper, and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until just barely browned, about 2 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Add the rice and mix thoroughly with the spiced meat mixture. Pour the water into the pot, season with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and bring to a boil. Decrease the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is just tender and the water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and mix in ½ cup of the nuts. Adjust the salt to taste. Transfer the stuffing to a bowl and set aside to cool.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bring the chicken to room temperature an hour before you’re ready to bake it.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">Stuff the cavity of the chicken loosely with 2 cups of the rice mixture. Reserve the remaining rice to reheat and serve alongside the cooked chicken. Tie the drumsticks together at the bottom with cooking twine to close the cavity.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172" role="doc-pagebreak" title="172"/>Drizzle the chicken with olive oil and set inside a Dutch oven or roasting pan, breast side up. Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil and roast for 1 hour. Remove the lid, increase the temperature to 400°F and continue to roast for another 30 minutes or until the chicken has browned on the outside and cooked through (a meat thermometer should read 165°F at the thickest part of the leg, near but not touching the bone). Remove the pan from the oven and set aside to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve whole on a platter, surrounded by the reserved stuffing. Garnish with the remaining ¼ cup nuts and the dill.</p>
			<p class="rp">The chicken can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 16 mini wraps or 4 full wraps</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">MUSAKHAN IS PERHAPS</span> the most iconic of all Palestinian chicken dishes. I often joke that while we don’t have a nation-state, we most certainly have a national dish. Extravagant and communal, the chicken is traditionally served whole, steeped in olive oil and reddish-purple sumac. It is mounded over caramelized onions atop a hearth-baked flatbread called taboon and soaked with the cooking juices. People sit around a table, using bite-size pieces of the bread to tear off bites of chicken.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I didn’t grow up eating it that way. Ever. My mother, like lots of Arab mothers in the United States, adapted the chicken-onion combo into tortilla rolls. Eating this wrap with sumac and onion juices drizzling down your arms is part of the experience and a sign of a good juicy braise. It’s equally great at room temperature and can be served as a party appetizer wrap.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This home recipe is adapted from my restaurant’s most popular wrap called the Pali-Cali, since it brings together Palestinian musakhan with arugula, producing something deeply satisfying and easier for non-Arabic speakers to pronounce. I like to add avocado for some extra California love. I think my family in Gaza would approve.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 4 thighs)</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons sumac</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Seven-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_26">this page</a>) or ground allspice</p>
			<p class="ril">5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
			<p class="ril">6 cups thinly sliced onions (about 2 onions)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</p>
			<p class="ril">4 pieces Saj Bread (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_73">this page</a>) or your favorite brand of 12-inch flour tortillas</p>
			<p class="ril">4 cups trimmed arugula</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup pomegranate seeds (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 avocado, sliced (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium bowl, rub the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon of the salt, 2 tablespoons of the sumac, and the spice mix and let them sit for 2 hours at room temperature or refrigerate overnight.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 300°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pan, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and ½ teaspoon of the salt and sauté until the onions are soft and translucent and slightly browned.</p>
			<p class="rp">Transfer 1 cup of the onions to an 8 by 8-inch baking dish and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Continue to caramelize the remaining onions on low heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Arrange the seasoned chicken in a single layer over the onions in the baking dish and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake until the chicken is cooked through and breaks apart easily with a fork, 55 to 65 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">While the chicken is baking, continue to caramelize the onions on low heat, stirring often, until they’re very soft and deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. It’s important to cook the onions slowly to reduce their liquid and bring out the sweetness. Remove the pan from the heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon sumac, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper and drizzle with the molasses. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Let cool slightly.</p>
			<p class="rp">Using two forks, pull apart the cooked chicken into bite-size shreds and fold the caramelized onion mixture into the cooked chicken.</p>
			<p class="rp">Lay out the flatbreads on a dry work surface and distribute the pulled chicken and onion mixture in a nice straight line down the center of each bread. Top with the arugula, pomegranate seeds, and avocado. Fold in the sides and roll up each flatbread, burrito-style, going from the bottom to the top. Drizzle the flatbreads with a little oil and give them a quick toast in a cast-iron skillet or heavy pan for some color.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve whole as a meal or sliced into quarters for the perfect party bite.</p>
			<p class="rp">The rolls can be stored covered or in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated or enjoyed at room temperature.</p>

				<p class="sbt">Ode to the Olive Tree</p>
				<p class="sb">Musakhan is an ode to the fellaheen—the farmers, harvesters, and cultivators of Palestinian land—and a tribute to the olive tree, which has a special place in our cuisine and heritage.</p>
				<p class="sb">Under Israeli occupation, authorities have uprooted more than 800,000 olive trees, some centuries old, and taken the land beneath them, politicizing the very ingredient that makes this dish so special. According to the charity organization Oxfam, this has resulted in a loss of more than $12 million a year for those families who rely on the olive harvest for their livelihood. It can take forty years for a tree to produce consistently mature olives, making the razing of trees an even greater affront to Palestinian history and survival.</p>
				<p class="sb">This, in addition to the displacement of Palestinians from their homes and farms in 1948 and the closure of Gaza from the rest of Palestine, has meant that millions of Palestinians can no longer access or afford olive oil. In fact, many Palestinians in Gaza no longer use olive oil to make their musakhan, instead substituting United Nations rations of canola oil.</p>
				<p class="sb">The rituals surrounding the olive harvest are a rite of passage, and fresh, properly harvested oil is a delicacy unto itself. It’s one I don’t take for granted as a Palestinian. I’ve witnessed the harvest in Lodi, California, with my good friends at Corto Olive Oil, and I am deeply thankful for participating in the magic of its cultivation in a way that my family back home <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176" role="doc-pagebreak" title="176"/>cannot.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I LOVE FOLLOWING</span> the tracks of Arabs who have arrived in different corners of the world, influencing and being influenced by the cuisine in their new homes. In the early 1900s, Levantine Arabs, mostly from Lebanon and Syria, fled to Mexico to avoid Ottoman rule. They brought along with them their love of marinated meats, grilled on outdoor spits, sliced thin, and served with pickled toppings and fresh herbs.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Al pastor, it turns out, is something that Mexicans took from the Lebanese and made even better, but I didn’t learn that until after I had left Boston, since my family did not eat pork when I was growing up. The first time I tried al pastor, sweetened with pineapple juice and spiced with chiles, was in California. Later, in Mexico City, when I saw the masters deftly turning meat to crispy perfection on a trompo, a spit, I felt a great affinity, since that is exactly how we eat shawarma.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Although it’s less common to see chicken bathed in the beautiful red spices of shawarma in the United States, chicken shawarma is actually quite popular back in the homeland. I remember one special occasion when my mom, coaxing me back to health when I was bedridden with mono at a young age, magically procured some and smuggled it into the hospital for me. It’s a reminder of the ways that food, especially bright, beautiful, flavorful food, is such an important part of healing.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Here, I’ve brought shawarma indoors, so I can enjoy it no matter the weather, marinating thin slabs of thigh meat overnight and sizzling the pieces quickly on a hot griddle or heavy pan.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This meat goes to the next level when it is paired with a healthy dose of the tangy spread Toum (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_41">this page</a>). This doubles as a taco night special and can be enjoyed with fixings such as hot sauce, Quick-Pickled Red Onions (see <a href="c02.xhtml#page_43c">this page</a>), fresh veggies, and avocados.</p>
			<p class="rilhf">Marinade</p>
			<p class="ril">6 dried guajillo chiles</p>
			<p class="ril">4 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup apple cider vinegar</p>
			<p class="ril">¾ cup pineapple juice</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon ground coriander</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ teaspoons ground cumin</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons Wild Thyme, Sumac, and Sesame Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_24">this page</a>) or oregano</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon ground chipotle chile (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon paprika</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat</p>
			<p class="ril">1 onion, sliced into ¾-inch wedges (with the core, so the onion doesn’t fall apart)</p>
			<p class="ril">Kosher salt for seasoning the onions, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">½ bunch parsley, coarsely chopped (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 recipe Saj Bread (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_73">this page</a>) or your favorite brand of 12-inch flour tortillas for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">To make the marinade: Cover the guajillo chiles <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178" role="doc-pagebreak" title="178"/>in hot water and allow to sit for 15 minutes or until soft. Remove the stems and seeds and chop into 1-inch pieces.</p>
			<p class="rp">Combine all of the remaining marinade ingredients in a blender and mix until well incorporated. Add the chiles and blend until everything is smooth.</p>
			<p class="rp">Bisect each chicken thigh widthwise to make thin slabs. This can be done by pressing your palm onto the thigh and making a lateral cut with small side-to-side sawing motions.</p>
			<p class="rp">Place the chicken in a medium bowl or in a resealable bag, add the marinade, and marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
			<p class="rp">Warm a cast-iron or flat heavy griddle over high heat. Making sure not to crowd the pan, sear the marinated chicken in batches, until both sides are nicely charred and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</p>
			<p class="rp">Set the chicken pieces aside as they come off the pan and cover to allow the meat to rest and reabsorb its juices. Once all the chicken is cooked, add just enough water to the pan to deglaze the juices and then drizzle over the chicken while it rests.</p>
			<p class="rp">Wipe out the griddle and, while the chicken is resting, grill the onion wedges over medium-high heat. Season with the salt and continue cooking over medium heat until tender, about 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Chop the chicken lengthwise into ½-inch strips and place into a serving bowl or on a platter. Fold the onion wedges into the cut meat and stir to incorporate. Adjust the salt and heat to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle with the parsley and cilantro and serve with flatbreads.</p>
			<p class="rp">Meat can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

				<p class="sbt">A Delicious Exchange</p>
				<p class="sb">My Oakland and San Francisco restaurants are both nestled in the beating heart of the cities’ Latinx districts. Many long, lean-staffed nights hustling to keep my restaurants open have ended with a late meal and a cold beer at a neighboring Mexican restaurant. Over time, the smells and tastes of the neighborhood have fed my imagination with menu ideas that play at the connection points between our cuisines.</p>
				<p class="sb">I love traveling through Mexico City, not only for its amazing food but also for the deep familiarity of the city’s century of Arab cultural influences from the different waves of Arab immigrants over the course of the twenty-first century. In many ways, the city resembles Beirut, a city of paradox, where rich and poor live side by side with the same propensity to enjoy a good life.</p>
				<p class="sb">After fleeing Ottoman rule, an influx of Lebanese immigrants imported spices and marinating methods across the Yucatan Peninsula, Puebla, and Mexico City in the early 1900s; a half-century later, in 1948, there was another influx to Veracruz of Palestinians fleeing the takeover of Palestine. In many of these areas today, Arab culture is visible and vibrant. Although Arab dishes have been given different Spanish names (labneh to joceques, for instance), they still retain a distinctly Arab identity. On the other hand, some foods have melded into Mexican cuisine, from the addition of sweet acidic pineapple and pork to transform shawarma into al pastor, to the introduction of tacos arabes, delicious marinated carne asada on leavened bread. I am inspired by this exchange, which has made the food even more delicious across both cultures.</p>

			<p class="rt">Arab-Spiced Burger Patties</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 6 patties</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">NO FOOD BETTER</span> represents my upbringing than this Arab-spiced ground lamb mix. Bursting with sweet onions and flecks of fresh parsley, infused with the spices of the Levant, my mom used this mix to make a variety of dishes: grilled patties, meatloaf wedged between grilled vegetables, or Kafta bil Bandoura (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_181">this page</a>), meatballs in tomato sauce. Simple to prepare, kafta makes the ultimate weeknight comfort food; with a little practice, it can go from fridge to table in about 20 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I love using kafta to make lamb burgers, a fan favorite at Reem’s. Although traditionally made with lamb alone, kafta has been adapted into a more economical mix of beef and lamb. For people sensitive to lamb’s gaminess, this can be a good option. Enjoy these burgers with your favorite buns or make your own Ka’ak (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_85">this page</a>) if you’re feeling ambitious. Enjoy with all your favorite burger fixings.</p>
			<p class="rtip"><span class="Balance-black-tip">Tip</span> • To get the caramelized edges that elevate the patties to a sublime crisp, the cooking temperature is key. Drop a pea-size morsel of meat into the pan to see if it sizzles. If the pan is not sufficiently hot, the meat will release its water and boil instead of fry. If it’s too hot, the meat will scorch before fully cooking inside. You want the oil shimmering but not smoking.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 cup coarsely chopped onions (about 1 onion)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup finely chopped parsley</p>
			<p class="ril">2 teaspoons ground allspice</p>

			<p class="ril">2 pounds ground lamb or beef (or mixture of both)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as sunflower or canola</p>
			<p class="rpf">Grate or pulse the onions in a food processor until they are finely mashed. Line a colander with cheesecloth to drain the onions or squeeze out the liquid by hand.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a large bowl, combine the onions, parsley, allspice, cinnamon, pepper, 1 teaspoon of the sumac, nutmeg, and salt. Add the meat and, using your hands, knead the meat into the onion-spice mixture. To keep the meet tender, avoid overmixing.</p>
			<p class="rp">Divide the meat into 6 even portions, roll into balls about the size of tennis balls (about 166 grams each). Using the flat side of your index and middle fingers, press down on the meatballs to create several shallow ridges in the surface of the meat while patting into ½-inch-thick, 4-inch-diameter patties. The ridges will crisp up and char while cooking.</p>
			<p class="rp">Heat an electric griddle to 400°F or a cast-iron or heavy skillet on medium-high heat. Drizzle a thin coat of the oil onto the griddle or skillet and grill the patties for 3 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
			<p class="rp">Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon sumac. Serve immediately.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS—</span>that’s all my sisters and I wanted; it’s what the other kids had, and we felt we should have some, too. My mother, ever adaptive, found ways to Arabize this Italian American classic. The more American my sisters and I tried to be, the more Arab spices my mom would add to the meatballs. Her innovation was so good that I felt it gave me bragging rights. I invited friends and soccer teammates over, insisting Arab spaghetti was, indeed, the best.</p>
			<p class="rhn">That’s a bold claim for a girl growing up in Boston, a hub for Italian American cooking. My best friend, Angela, and my sister’s best friend, Elissa, both came from Italian homes, and we learned to eat the way they did, spinning a fork against the inside of a soupspoon to wrap the spaghetti into a bite-size nest.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Delicious as a weeknight dinner, packed as leftovers for lunch, and good enough to serve to guests, this dish represents my Arab American upbringing in a nutshell: it’s equal parts Arab, American, and Italian (well, Italian American).</p>
			<p class="rilf">1 recipe Arab-Spiced Burger Patties (<a href="c06.xhtml#page_179">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="rilh">Sauce</p>

			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon coarsely chopped garlic (about 4 cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>

			<p class="rt">Slow-Cooked Lamb Shoulder</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IT’S HARD TO</span> resist filling up on bites of tender, succulent, flavor-infused chunks of lamb while preparing this dish. Growing up, I associated lamb roasts with holiday feasts. Otherwise, the lamb we ate was ground or stewed and mixed with beef to economize. My mother had no time to cook things low and slow. “That’s what pressure cookers are for,” she would say.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Except for one unforgettable year: in honor of Eid al-Adha, my father decided to engage in the biblical act of slaughtering a lamb and surprised my mother with a 100-pound gift. I will never forget the look on my mother’s face as she asked my father what she was supposed to do with all that lamb. With the help of a few friends, my mother set the lamb on a table in the backyard, pulled out a high-powered electric saw, and got to work. Lamb filled our freezer for the rest of the year.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I must have channeled my mother when I became fascinated with whole-animal cookery. Pitmasters from Oakland to Texas were approaching me for collaborations. I thought, “Why are these legends reaching out to an Arab bread maker?” Over time, it became clear to me that every culture has its own craft barbecue, and that Arab bread makes an extraordinary pairing with roasted meat.</p>
			<p class="rhn">My first outdoor whole-lamb undertaking was a 100 pounder, ordered for the wedding of a first-generation Lebanese customer. I invested in a <span class="i">caja china,</span> a “giant Mexican roasting box,” and made my way to Sonoma County to cook for a hundred hungry guests in the middle of nature—just me, the elements, and some BBQ enthusiasts from Laytonville, California, who coached me through the process. It was a huge hit, and I was hooked.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This recipe is designed for a home setting and achieves equally delicious results. The most succulent lamb cut is the shoulder, but if that’s not readily available, leg or shank is delicious, too. We save and use every bit of the meat, including turning the flavor-infused drippings from slow-roasted lamb into a consommé, a rich broth made from the aromatics and juices of the lamb. In my restaurant, we serve the lamb in a sandwich along with jus, like a French dipping broth, on the side.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Cooking times will vary, based on the weight of the meat. This recipe calls for 3 to 3½ hours for 3 to 4 pounds of meat. Add about a half hour of cooking time for each additional one-half pound: the bigger the cut, the longer it needs to spend in the oven.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Salting beforehand improves the rendering of the rich fat from the meat.</p>
			<p class="rilf">3- to 4-pound bone-in or boneless lamb shoulder</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ tablespoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="rilh">Marinade</p>
			<p class="ril">10 garlic cloves</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>

			<p class="ril">1 recipe Tangy Garlic Spread (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_41">this page</a>) for serving</p>
			<p class="ril">Rice for serving (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">Slit a crosshatched pattern into the lamb shoulder about ½ inch deep at the fattiest part and poke knife holes all over the meat. Rub the meat thoroughly with the salt, cover, and let rest, unrefrigerated, while you prepare the marinade.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the marinade: In a food processor or blender, combine the ingredients and mix on medium speed into a paste. Rub the paste into the meat’s crevices and marinate, covered, for at least 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. If refrigerating, remove the lamb at least 1 hour before cooking.</p>
			<p class="rp">Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic pieces, cut side down, and sauté until blackened and the onions have wilted and are starting to fall apart but are not cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Remove the onions and garlic from the pot and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_183" role="doc-pagebreak" title="183"/>Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the same pot, pour in the 2 remaining tablespoons oil and sear the lamb over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, starting with the skin side down, until a charred crust forms on all sides. Tuck the onions and garlic back into the pot under the lamb.</p>
			<p class="rp">Dissolve the molasses in the water and pour just enough of it over the lamb to come up to half the side of the shoulder, then cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil. Braise in the oven until the meat is sliding off the bone, about 3½ hours.</p>
			<p class="rp">Carefully set the cooked lamb aside. When it’s cool enough to handle, pull the meat from the bone, tear it into bite-size pieces, and heap it onto a serving dish. Strain and reserve the braising liquid. Pour about a cup of the liquid over the lamb to keep it moist. Adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Discard the onions, garlic, and bones.</p>
			<p class="rp">Simmer the remaining broth. Skim off some of the fat and reserve it to use for grilled vegetables, roasted cauliflower, or potatoes; it will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a month. When the broth has reduced by half, it’s ready to serve as a jus for pouring or dipping.</p>
			<p class="rp">Serve this mashawi like shawarma or a taco, wrapped in torn shreds of flatbreads, topped with pickled red onions, parsley, and garlic spread. You can also just eat dipped in jus or served over rice.

She learned how to make this recipe from her best friend, Khadijah, a dumpling pro, who, like her, worked in the field of genetics.</p>

			<p class="rp">To mix by hand: Using your hands, drizzle in the oil and incorporate, until the flour forms a fine crumble. Form a well inside the center, pour in the warm water, and slowly incorporate the flour from the inside of the well to bring the dough together. Turn out the dough on a flat work surface, dusted with flour as needed, and knead until the dough forms a smooth, elastic ball, about 5 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To mix in a stand mixer: Using the paddle attachment on slow speed, drizzle in the oil until the flour forms a fine crumble. Switch to the dough hook and slowly add the warm water. Drizzle in 1 more teaspoon of water at a time if needed to make the dough come together. Once the dough forms, remove the dough from the bowl and place on a flat work surface, dusted with flour as needed, and knead by hand until the dough forms a smooth, elastic ball, about 3 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Seal the ball in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: While the dough is resting, in a large bowl combine the meat, onions, spice mix, salt, pepper, molasses, and yogurt and knead the mixture like a dough, until it is thoroughly mixed. Alternatively, you can use a food processor. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the mint oil: Prepare a small bowl of ice water and set aside. Submerge the mint in boiling water for 30 seconds, remove from the heat, and plunge it into the ice water to stop the cooking. Remove the mint from the water and pat dry with paper towels.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small food processor or blender at medium speed, blend the mint with the oil until as smooth as possible, about 30 seconds. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to <span class="numerator1">1</span>⁄<span class="denominator1">16</span>-inch thickness, flouring the rolling pin and dough liberally, if needed, to prevent sticking. Let the dough relax for 5 minutes or so after rolling. With a dough cutter or the rim of a cup, cut out 3-inch circles. Cover the circles with a dish towel while you roll and cut out the rest of the dough. Set the scraps aside to rest, then knead them into a ball, roll into a sheet, and repeat the cutting process.</p>
			<div class="float_right_qa">
				<img alt="" class="image" src="../images/19.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="rp">To make the dumplings: Put a tablespoon of the filling in the center of each dough round. Using your finger or a pastry brush, moisten the edges with water. Gently fold the dough in half and press the edges with your fingers to seal, expelling any air bubbles before closing the last portion. Pull the corners of each half-moon around the index finger of one hand and pinch together with your other hand to bind, forming a cupped outer edge and dimpled belly center. Place the dumplings on a lightly floured sheet tray. Repeat the process, shaping all of the dumplings. Refrigerate, uncovered, if not cooking right away.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the yogurt sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the yogurt, garlic, cornstarch, salt, and cold water and whisk to incorporate. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer over low heat. Use a spatula or wooden spoon and scrape the bottom of the pan to make sure the sauce doesn’t burn. Adjust the salt to taste. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside until the dumplings are cooked.</p>
			<p class="rp">When you are ready to cook the dumplings, bring the 12 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add the dumplings to form a single layer (about twelve at a time). The dumplings should float and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them into the yogurt sauce, gently tilting the pan from side to side to coat the dumplings evenly. Return the pan to low heat to make sure the dumplings <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187" role="doc-pagebreak" title="187"/>are warmed through. If your sauce has gotten too thick, you can drizzle in some of your dumpling water to thin it. Repeat the process until all of the dumplings are cooked and coated in sauce.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spoon into shallow bowls to serve and drizzle with the mint oil. Top with the pine nuts, mint, Aleppo pepper, and sumac.</p>
			<p class="rp">The dumplings can be stored frozen for up to 6 months. To keep their shape, freeze them first on a parchment-lined tray, then transfer to an airtight container or resealable bag for easy storage.</p>

			<p class="rhn">Maybe it was its collective, celebratory nature that appealed to my Amtu (the Arabic title for an aunt on your father’s side) Elham, who came all the way from Syria, not once but three times to help take care of us, staying months at a time. Amtu, my father’s elder sister who had helped raise him, had lost her husband early on, so it makes sense he would call on her to help take care of us when my mother decided to go back to school. Amtu’s visits featured plenty of shakriyah, a caretaking dish for her. After her departure, it would become a comfort dish for my mother to carry on her tradition, and it has now become mine as well.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SEARED INTO GOLDEN</span> torpedoes, topped with squiggly tentacles, and nested in bright red sauce, these stuffed squid pack a lot of wow on the plate. The squid’s immersion in arak-spiked tomato sauce is at once a tribute to my family’s coastal roots on the shores of Gaza and entirely my own creation.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Growing up, I thought calamari came as a crispy first course in an Italian restaurant. As I threw myself into the art of Palestinian cuisine, I came across Joudie Kalla’s stuffed squid in her book <span class="i">Palestine on a Plate</span>. A light bulb went off for me: of course, we have squid, and, of course, we stuff it just like everything else.</p>
			<p class="rhn">This is my take on a popular Spanish dish of squid stuffed with breadcrumbs and chorizo. I stuff mine with bulgur and sujuk, a dry spicy, fermented East Asian sausage similar to chorizo, made beautifully by Armenians and common in Arab dishes. This fennel-tomato seafood combo draws inspiration from flavors, doused with arak, our anise-infused liquor, to give it an extra kick. While you have the bottle out, you might exercise the cook’s prerogative: pour a splash over a cube of ice and watch the clear arak transform to a misty fog.</p>
			<p class="rilh">Sauce</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 fennel bulb, quartered lengthwise, with fronds reserved for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic (about 4 garlic cloves)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup arak, ouzo, Pernod, aguardiente, or any anise-flavored liquor</p>
			<p class="ril">One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes</p>

			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons finely chopped dill (about 5 sprigs), plus more for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 4 cloves)</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">Kosher salt for seasoning the tentacles</p>
			<p class="ril">1 lemon, cut into quarters for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192" role="doc-pagebreak" title="192"/>To make the sauce: Warm the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the fennel and sear, turning until the cut and rounded sides are golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the arak and scrape any cooked bits from the bottom of the pan into the bubbling liquor. Cook until the arak is almost evaporated. Add the tomatoes, stock, salt, spice mix, Aleppo pepper, and saffron. Bring to a boil. Then turn off the heat and set aside until ready to cook the squid.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a small bowl, immerse the bulgur in cold water and soak for 10 minutes. Drain in a fine-mesh strainer, press out the water, and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To clean the squid: Cut just below the eyes to remove the tentacles, being careful to remove the sharp beak between the eyes and the tentacles. Set the tentacles aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the hard cartilage by gripping the end tightly and slowly twisting and pulling until the whole thing slides out. Tug on the eye section of the squid, and the guts should also come out cleanly from the body. Using a sharp knife or your fingers, slice or pull away the winglike portions from the tip of the body. The skin should easily pull away as well. Give everything a rinse and pat dry.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the stuffing: In a large bowl, combine the chile, onions, sujuk, dill, salt, and garlic. Add the bulgur and mix until incorporated.</p>
			<p class="rp">Stuff each squid two-thirds full, leaving room for the bulgur to expand, and thread the closure with a toothpick.</p>
			<p class="rp">When you’re ready to cook the squid, warm the oil in a heavy pan over high heat. Season the stuffed squid with a pinch of salt and sear until golden brown on both sides. Transfer each squid to the pot with the tomato sauce and fennel; tuck them in to make sure they are covered by the sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and cook for 20 more minutes to allow the sauce to reduce slightly.</p>
			<p class="rp">Season the tentacles with a pinch of salt. In the same heavy pan, sauté the tentacles until just done, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To serve, transfer the squid and sauce to a serving tray. Sprinkle with the tentacles and garnish with the dill and fennel fronds. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.</p>

				<p class="sbt">The Tomato’s Twisted Route to the Arab World</p>
				<p class="sb">Many of my recipes use tomatoes—sweet, acidic, and juicy. The Arab World’s dry heat allows for a longer growing season than here in the United States, extending its availability and thus its popularity. But how did this fruit of the Americas make its way into so many foundational dishes of Arab Levantine cuisine?</p>
				<p class="sb">Food documentarians trace one point of entry to the British, who arrived in Aleppo for the bustling trade of the Ottoman Empire toward the end of the eighteenth century. They brought tomato seeds they had likely received from the Spaniards, who centuries before had seized more than gold from the Aztecs and Incas, whose civilizations they eventually wiped out in South America. They also pilfered seeds, including those of the tomato. The vine did not receive a warm welcome in Europe. It was considered a “devil’s fruit,” from the family of poisonous nightshades. The colonists had no interest in learning about the plant from its Indigenous cultivators, and it languished.</p>
				<p class="sb">Eventually, farmers in warmer countries like Spain and southern Italy recognized the tomato’s versatility and overcame their fears; it soon became a staple of Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato went on to become among the Levant’s largest crops, both for domestic use and export, securing its place as an important ingredient for the economy and the cuisine, becoming an affordable source of acidity to replace increasingly expensive traditional ingredients such as tamarinds and sour plums.</p>

			<p class="rt">Gazan Clay Pot Shrimp</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">I HAD NO</span> idea my people ate shrimp until I came across a version of this dish in Laila El-Haddad’s <span class="i">The Gaza Kitchen</span>. My memories of shrimp dishes are limited to eating shrimp scampi with my family at TGI Fridays on occasional weekends. I was searching for shrimp in a sauce, and this is a <span class="i">magnificent</span> sauce. The restaurant industry has taught me a few seafood techniques, including the secret to making a rich shrimp sauce: sear and then slow-cook the shrimp heads and shells. You can get shrimp heads from a butcher or buy whole shrimp and reserve the heads.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Laila’s dish is tomato-based, but I have added red bell peppers to sweeten it, and I evoke its Gazan roots with a touch of dillseed and hot pepper. This dish is traditionally cooked in a clay pot in a high-heat hearth, allowing the shrimp to poach and the natural sugars in the sauce to caramelize and char, giving it a nice depth of flavor. Since most of us don’t have clay pots at home, I created that flavor by charring the base vegetables and getting a nice caramelization on the shrimp shells before adding the liquid.</p>
			<p class="rhn">You can make this sauce ahead of time. Rewarm and poach the shrimp in the sauce just before serving.</p>
			<p class="rilf">3 pounds large shrimp, with heads and shells on (U-10 size if you can find them)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 thinly sliced yellow onion</p>
			<p class="ril">2 red bell peppers, thinly sliced</p>

			<p class="ril">¼ teaspoon dillseed (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or Chile-Spice Mix (<a href="c01.xhtml#page_27">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</p>

			<p class="ril">1 bay leaf</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup Fish Stock (<a href="c02.xhtml#page_37">this page</a>), store-bought fish stock, or water</p>

			<p class="ril">Arab Bread (<a href="c03.xhtml#page_71">this page</a>) or rice for serving</p>
			<p class="rpf">Remove the heads and shells from the shrimp. Set the heads and shells aside for making the tomato-pepper sauce.</p>
			<p class="rp">Devein the shrimp tails. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a stockpot over medium heat, char the onions, bell peppers, and fennel bulb for about 5 minutes or until they have a bit of color. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the sauce: In the same pot, sauté the shrimp heads and shells in the oil until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add back half of the charred onion-fennel mixture to the pot, along with the garlic, paprika, cumin, coriander, fennel seeds, dillseed, Aleppo pepper, and salt. Stir and continue to cook to soften and use the juices from the vegetables to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the tomatoes, bay leaf, and stock and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes or until the sauce develops flavor and sweetness. Using a slotted spoon for scooping, discard the bay leaf and shrimp heads and shells.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a food processor or food mill, blend the sauce and then push through a fine-mesh strainer. If you prefer a stronger seafood flavor, puree the heads and shells in the sauce before straining. (This makes about 2 cups of sauce for cooking the shrimp and 1 cup of solids to discard.)</p>
			<p class="rp"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194" role="doc-pagebreak" title="194"/>Return the sauce to the pot with the remaining onion-fennel mixture and bring to a simmer over medium heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, season the shrimp tails with a sprinkle of salt and add to the sauce. Gently warm until the shrimp turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat immediately and scoop onto a serving platter. Squeeze lemon juice over the mixture to add some brightness and drizzle with the oil.

			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 to 6 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">NO DISH TRANSPORTS</span> me to my Gazan roots quicker than sayadiyah. Translated to “the catch,” this dish is traditionally made with fried fish scraps and rice, laced with caramelized onions and warming spices. Sayadiyah is prepared around the Arabian Gulf and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In Gaza, the dish cannot be separated from the reality of Israeli occupation. Fishermen, who for generations have made their living selling fish, now risk bullets when they take to the waters. In a culture that once subsisted on fish, seafood has become a luxury.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I think the women in my family instinctively keep this dish alive not just for nostalgia but also to maintain continuity with our heritage. My mom often turns to this dish to impress someone new. It’s the dish she chose to make on the day I first brought my husband home to meet the family. He was hooked. To this day, whenever we visit my mother, he asks, “Is she making us sayadiyah?”</p>
			<p class="rhn">I substitute a braise for the fry, inspired by the sweet-savory umami flavors in my favorite Vietnamese clay pot dish called cá kho. Where cá kho uses a burnt sugar and fish sauce, I create an intensely aromatic fish broth, naturally sweetened with caramelized onions. Then I reduce it to braise the fish and cook the rice.</p>

			<p class="ril">Coarsely chopped parsley for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">2 lemons, cut into wedges for garnish</p>
			<p class="rpf">Toast and crush the coriander and cumin seeds and mix. Reserve 2 teaspoons for the broth and 2 teaspoons for coating the fish.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a medium pot, warm ¼ cup of the oil over medium-high heat and add the onions. Turn down the heat to medium and season with ½ teaspoon of the salt, stirring with increasing frequency toward the end, until the onions turn a deep mahogany brown, about 35 minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">In the same pot, add the 2 teaspoons of crushed spices, garlic, and ginger. Cook for a minute or two or until the garlic and ginger are aromatic. Add the cinnamon stick and the fish stock. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes or until the broth has taken on the rich brown hue of the onions, which are now mostly dissolved, and the broth has reduced to about 4 cups of liquid. Pour the darkened stock through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve any onions for the rice.</p>
			<p class="rp">In a separate pot, over medium-high heat, add the remaining ¼ cup oil and rice and stir until the rice is coated. Stir in the reserved onions and add 3 cups of the enriched broth plus 1 teaspoon of the salt. Bring to a boil, turn down the temperature to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes or until all the stock is absorbed. Fluff and adjust the salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Keep remaining cup of broth simmering on low heat and stir in honey and turmeric. Adjust salt to taste.</p>
			<p class="rp">To prepare the fish: While the rice is cooking and broth remains hot, season the fish with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and add the remaining 2 teaspoons of the reserved crushed spices.</p>
			<p class="rp">Heat the oil in a large pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat and sear (don’t cook all the way) the fish on both sides, until the spices form a light crust, 30 to 45 seconds on each side. It’s important to use high heat so that you give color and crust to the spices, although the fish will remain mostly uncooked in the center. If your pan isn’t large enough to fit all of the fish at one time, sear the pieces in batches, moving them to a plate while you sear the rest. Return all fish pieces together in a single layer back into the pan and pour in the reserved seasoned broth. Simmer gently on low heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until the fish flakes easily and a cake tester or toothpick goes through the fish with no resistance.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, spoon the rice onto a serving platter, place the fish on top of the rice, and add the remaining broth. Garnish with the parsley and lemon wedges.</p>

				<p class="bxt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196" role="doc-pagebreak" title="196"/>TIPS FOR FINDING AND CLEANING THE FRESHEST FISH</p>
				<p class="bxf">Purchasing a whole fish can help ensure you get the freshest fish available. There are a few ways to tell if your fish is fresh. The eyes should be shiny and bright. The gills should be pink with no slime. When you press the flesh of the fish, it should bounce back with a firm texture. You can ask your fishmonger to make sure the fish is cleaned, meaning that the scales, guts, gills, and fins have been removed. Leave the head and the tail attached.</p>
				<p class="bx">To clean a whole fish yourself: Lay the fish flat against a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, make a shallow slit from the hole on the underside of the belly near the tail toward the head. Gently pull out the guts and rinse the fish clean under cold water. Pat dry and lay the fish down again to remove the scales. Holding the tail, pull the knife blade in the opposite direction of the scales to remove them. Doing this under a gentle stream of cold water can help with the mess. Another trick is to do this inside a large bag to keep the scales from flying around. Once scaled, use kitchen shears to cut away all of the fins, except for the tail. You can also clip out the gills using shears. Give your fish one more rinse and pat dry.</p>

Every time I pull these gorgeous stuffed fish from the oven, sizzling with spice rub and popping with the scent of citrus, I am transported for a moment back to her kitchen and even further back to her childhood in Yaffa, a Palestinian city known the world over for its oranges. I created this dish based on stories extracted from my mother’s foggy memory of her mother’s cooking in Gaza. It was my grandmother’s own version, or so my mother told me, of a dish more commonly made with lemons.</p>
			<p class="rhn">I never got the chance to confirm this version of the dish. As my grandmother’s health deteriorated so, too, did the memories. I honored her by sharing this dish at the James Beard House’s culinary celebration, as an homage to my grandmother’s journey and the way in which she brought family back together with each uprooting. This dish reminds me that her life carries on, through me.</p>

			<p class="ril">¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice (about 1 orange)</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup tahini, at room temperature</p>
			<p class="ril">1½ tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</p>
			<p class="ril">Zest of 1 lemon</p>
			<p class="rilh">Garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">1 fennel bulb, shaved across the grain into thin slices, with ¼ cup fronds reserved for garnish</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup picked parsley leaves</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup picked cilantro leaves</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup mint leaves (about ½ bunch)</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon orange zest</p>
			<p class="ril">Pinch of kosher salt</p>
			<p class="rpf"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199" role="doc-pagebreak" title="199"/>Lay the fish flat on their sides and, using a sharp knife, make three shallow horizontal slits (from the heads to the tails) about ¼ inch deep into the fillet of each fish. (See Tips for Finding and Cleaning the Freshest Fish on <a href="c06.xhtml#page_196">this page</a>.) Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the filling: In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix until incorporated.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the rub: In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix until they form a paste.</p>
			<p class="rp">Preheat the oven to 400°F. Arrange one oven rack in the center and another at the top of the oven. Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.</p>
			<p class="rp">Coat the outside and inside of each fish with the rub, making sure to get into the slits in the belly of the fish. Divide the filling into 3 portions and stuff the cavity of each fish. Set the fish on the prepared sheet tray and set aside, unrefrigerated, to temper while the oven is heating.</p>
			<p class="rp">To make the sauce: While the fish is tempering, grate the garlic directly into a small bowl to preserve the juices. Add the orange juice, tahini, lemon juice, and zest and whisk to combine. The sauce should be just thin enough to pour off the tip of a spoon in a steady drizzle without clumping. If needed, thin by whisking in cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time. If you dip a spoon into the sauce and let the excess drip away, you should be able to run your finger down the back of the spoon, leaving a line where your finger touched. Set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Cook the fish on the center oven rack for 20 minutes. Set the oven to broil, move the fish to the top oven rack, and cook on broil until sizzling and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the fish to crisp on the other side and broil for another 2 to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200" role="doc-pagebreak" title="200"/>minutes.</p>
			<p class="rp">Just before serving, combine the fennel, parsley, cilantro, and mint in a small bowl. Add the oil, orange zest, and salt and mix to incorporate. Set aside to garnish the fish.</p>
			<p class="rp">When ready to serve, spread half of the sauce on a serving platter, lay the fish across it, and sprinkle the garnish on top. Serve the remaining sauce alongside.</p>
