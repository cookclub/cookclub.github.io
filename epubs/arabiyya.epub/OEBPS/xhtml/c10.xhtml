			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IT COULD BE</span> argued that at the very center of Arab hospitality lies a small steaming pot of coffee, inspiring a moment of shared appreciation for its complex roasted flavor compounds.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Coffee was my grandmother’s ultimate gesture of generosity. When she poured it, she’d offer each person extra sugar, and the requests would come in fractional increments: one teaspoon for this aunt, a half teaspoon for that one, until everyone had their coffee just the way they liked it. The lion’s share of the delicate crema—the fine foam formed from coffee’s soluble oils on the surface—would usually go into the first cup. She’d hand that cup to whomever she wanted to make feel special that day. Or, if it were a routine morning, she might distribute the crema with a small pour into each cup, followed by a larger pour to bring it to the top.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Each cup had to be filled to the brim, to be lifted by the saucer and gingerly sipped to avoid spillage. I am passing along her method in the hope you will find what works for you and make it your own.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The storytelling that comes at the end might be my favorite part of drinking coffee the Arab way. Coffee reading is a ritual passed down over many centuries through the family. We use the Rorschach-like patterns in the grounds at the bottom of an inverted cup to tell the future of the person who’d drunk it. My mother is a pro. When she finishes her coffee, she flips the cup onto her saucer and lets the liquid slide away. Reading the swirling patterns in the sediment, she tells stories to friends and family. The moral for men always seems to be that a husband’s role is to make his wife’s life a little easier. I love the way she uses our traditional rituals to subvert patriarchy.</p>
			<p class="rilf">3 or 4 cardamom pods</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 heaping tablespoons finely ground Arabic or Turkish coffee beans</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon sugar (optional), plus more to taste</p>
			<p class="rpf">Crack the cardamom pods, pressing them on a hard surface with the flat side of a knife.</p>
			<p class="rp">Fill the rakweh or small saucepan with water. Add the cardamom pods and bring to a boil, then remove from the heat.</p>
			<p class="rp">Spoon the coffee into the pot. The coffee will rest on top of the water. Spoon the sugar on top of the coffee.</p>
			<p class="rp">Turn down the heat to low and ease one edge of the pot over the heat. As the water begins to boil, it will pull clumps of coffee down and start to bubble. When you see this happen, remove the pot from the heat to quiet the bubbles, rotate the pot a quarter turn, and then ease it back over the heat to bubble up a new side. Continue pulling from the heat, rotating, and returning, until all of the coffee has been incorporated. Resist the temptation to stir. Do not overboil (or boil over, for that matter)! The entire process goes pretty quickly—around 10 minutes from start to finish, depending on the size of the pot and the strength of the burner.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the pot from the heat, cover with a small saucer, and set aside to rest for 3 to 5 minutes. Doing this will allow the grounds to settle and produces a frothy head of crema on top.</p>
			<p class="rp">Pour each serving to the very brim of a small espresso cup or teacup. Add sugar to taste.</p>

			<p class="rt">Thickened Hot Chocolate</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes 4 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SAHLAB IS A</span> really delicate pudding in liquid form. The addition of chocolate to this traditional Ottoman beverage makes the ultimate winter comfort drink. Sahlab’s milkiness is traditionally thickened with orchid root. (Its namesake comes from the Turkish word <span class="i">salep</span>, which means “orchid root.”)</p>
			<p class="rhn">But mass consumption has made this root harder to find, and people, including me, have turned to alternate thickening agents. If you’re lucky enough to find sahlab, its floral fragrance will add something special, but I love mine just the way it is.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Sahlab reminds me of atole, an indigenous corn based–thickened drink from Mexico that becomes champurrado when spiked with chocolate. I’m not the only one who thinks so! One day, in our restaurant kitchen, while stirring a pot of sahlab, one of the cooks suggested it would be good with chocolate, and she was absolutely right. Now I always make mine with chocolate.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Sahlab can easily become vegan by swapping in almond milk for the dairy.</p>
			<p class="rilf">4 cups whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<p class="ril">¼ cup chopped pistachios, walnuts, and/or almonds</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut</p>
			<p class="ril">1 teaspoon orange zest (optional)</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a large saucepan, combine the milk, cornstarch, and sugar and whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the mixture begins to bubble, about 5 minutes. Add the cocoa, turn down the heat to low, and continue to simmer, stirring frequently until the mixture thickens considerably, about 10 minutes. It should resemble a runny pudding, forming a thick ribbon when drizzled from a spoon back into the pot.</p>
			<p class="rp">Remove the pan from the heat and add the vanilla and orange blossom water.</p>
			<p class="rp">Divide evenly among 4 mugs, top with the cinnamon, nuts, coconut, and orange zest, and serve immediately.</p>

			<p class="rt">Damascus Lemonade</p>
			<p class="ryno">Makes about 8 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">IN MY RESTAURANTS,</span> I call this drink Damascus lemonade to give it a sense of place. Spiked with orange blossom water, it’s our most popular drink, no matter the time of year.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Whenever we used to walk into the homes of friends and family in Syria and Lebanon, the first thing we’d usually hear is, “Let me get you a lemonade.” Except there, they called it polo. I did a little sleuthing to try to find out why this lemonade has a distinctly non-Arab name (we don’t even have the letter <span class="i">P</span> in Arabic). The theory that I favor traces the name to a British breath mint called Polo. This adds up. The drink is distinctly minty, and it’s even green in color. Calling it that is consistent with the Syrian habit of giving names to foods that make little sense but that nonetheless catch on, and before you know it, everyone’s using that name.</p>
			<p class="rhn">The sweet-and-sour combo with blossom notes also makes an outstanding gin cocktail for a hot day or at any time of the year, whenever you’re craving a bright, sparkling drink.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1½ cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">4 cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">2½ cups lemon juice</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons orange blossom water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups mint leaves (about 2 bunches)</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a medium pot, combine the sugar and water and heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat. Add the lemon juice and orange blossom water. Blend the mint with a small amount of the liquid and strain back in. Allow the lemonade to cool and serve over ice.</p>
			<p class="r1t" id="page_277a">Variation: Lemonade and Gin Cocktail</p>
			<p class="r1y">Makes 1 serving</p>
			<p class="r1ilf">2 ounces gin</p>
			<p class="r1il">3 ounces Damascus Lemonade (recipe above)</p>
			<p class="r1il">Sparkling water to taste</p>
			<p class="r1pf">Fill a glass with ice. Add the gin and lemonade. Top with the sparkling water. Stir.</p>

			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">HIBISCUS’S TART, BRIGHT</span> flavor and deep crimson color make it a favorite for punch mixes from the Latino neighborhoods of my restaurants to the swirling drink mixers on the counters of street-side eateries in Egypt. There’s no denying it; this is a fun drink. I cap the animated flavors of the hibiscus flowers with a dose of rose water to turn the drink into a floral bouquet.</p>
			<p class="rilf">1¼ cups sugar</p>
			<p class="ril">8 cups water</p>
			<p class="ril">2 cups hibiscus flowers</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons rose water</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a large pot, combine the sugar and water and heat until the sugar dissolves. Add the flowers and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn down the heat to the lowest setting and simmer for 15 minutes. Strain out the flowers and add the rose water. Allow to cool and serve over ice.</p>
			<p class="rp">The drink can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_279" role="doc-pagebreak" title="279"/>weeks.</p>

			<p class="ry">Makes 4 servings</p>
			<p class="rhnf"><span class="upper">SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A</span> drink and a dessert, these fruit refreshments are served by street corner vendors and in cafés all over Lebanon. They are a perfect treat, made with tart berries, hunks of fruit, velvety sweet avocados, blossomy Ashta (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>), and sweet nuttiness with the honey-almond topping.</p>
			<p class="rhn">In the summer, these are loaded with up to seven different fruits, from strawberries and kiwis to mangos and bananas. Any seasonal fruit will work.</p>
			<p class="rhn">When I don’t have time to make my own, I get my fix on hot afternoons by picking up tall cups of chile-lime Mexican mangonadas in the neighborhoods around my cafés or creamy avocado Vietnamese sinh tõ bò in Chinatown. It’s the Vietnamese version that inspired the addition of condensed milk with avocado puree to mine.</p>
			<p class="rhn">Differing densities and colors layer together into an art piece; in this case, representing the Lebanese flag. With the addition of a few blackberries on top of the fruit mix, that flag can easily become Palestinian!</p>
			<p class="rilf">2 avocados, pitted, scooped, and the flesh frozen</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup whole milk</p>
			<p class="ril">2 tablespoons condensed milk</p>
			<p class="ril">1 pound frozen strawberries or mixed berries</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup water, plus more as needed</p>
			<p class="ril">1 cup fruit of your choice, cut into 1-inch cubes and/or slices (optional)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ recipe Clotted Cream (<a href="c09.xhtml#page_254">this page</a>)</p>
			<p class="ril">½ cup sliced almonds</p>
			<p class="ril">1 tablespoon honey</p>
			<p class="rpf">In a blender, combine the avocado, whole milk, and condensed milk and puree until smooth. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer (if you want a smoother mix) and set aside.</p>
			<p class="rp">Rinse the blender and puree the frozen berries with ½ cup water to the desired consistency.</p>
			<p class="rp">To assemble, divide the avocado puree evenly among four tall glasses. Next divide the berry puree among the glasses, followed by the fruit cubes. Add a dollop of clotted cream on top of each glass. Sprinkle each glass with the nuts and drizzle with the honey for the final touch.</p>
			<p class="rp">Enjoy with a spoon or a straw.</p>
